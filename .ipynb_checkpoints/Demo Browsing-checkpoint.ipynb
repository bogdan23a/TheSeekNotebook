Hands-on sessions, lectures and software demonstrations will provide attendees with the necessary skills to apply components of the FAIRDOM infrastructure in their daily work for interrelating and exchanging data, models and corresponding information.\n\nFAIRDOM is a research infrastructure offering data management support. The SEEK software is designed as registry and storage place for data, models, biological samples, processes, publications and presentations, and at the same time as yellow pages for projects, people and events. SEEK is implemented as central data management platform in research networks such as LiSyM (https://seek.lisym.org), but also as cross-project platform FAIRDOMhub (https://www.fairdomhub.org) used e.g. by the European ERASysAPP initiative. The tutorial is jointly organized by LiSyM, ERASysAPP and the the German Network for Bioinformatics Infrastructure (de.NBI).\n\nParticipants need to bring their own laptop.\n\n\nPRESENTATIONS\nFAIRDOM tutorial workshop SBMC2018 Bremen -

ITNs bring together universities, research institutes, industry and clinical partners from across the world to train researchers to doctorate level.\n\nMetabolic diseases are a burden on the European population and health care system. It is increasingly recognised that individual differences with respect to history, lifestyle, and genetic make-up affect disease progression and treatment response. A Systems Medicine approach, based on computational models fed with individual patient data, has the potential to provide the basis for a personalised diagnosis and treatment strategy. The PoLiMeR consortium (Polymers in the Liver: Metabolism and Regulation) has identified the inherited, liver-related diseases of glycogen and lipid metabolism as the ideal starting point for innovative research training in personalised ‘Systems Medicine'.\n\n\nINSTITUTIONS\nHeidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies (HITS gGmbH)\nUniversity of Bergen\nUniversity of Duesseldorf\nUniversity of Groningen\nUniversity of Leiden\nChalmers University of Technology\nUniversity of Freiburg\nUniversity of Luxembourg\nIceni Diagnostics Ltd\nJohn Innes Centre\nMimetas\nORGANISMS\nHomo sapiens\nPEOPLE\nOlga Krebs\nWolfgang Müller\nBarbara Bakker\nAdil Mardinoglu\nInes Thiele\nKathrin Thedieck\nMathias Ziegler\nKaren Van Eunen\nMaaike H.

The quantification of these liver functions is essential to assess the status of the liver, obtain information about the degree of impairment, to evaluate treatment response or to select transplant recipients.\r\n\r\nWithin the Systems Medicine of the Liver (LiSyM) consortium we establish a standardized multiscale model framework of the human liver readily adaptable to various quantitative liver function tests currently used in the clinics. The resulting models will be personalized with individual imaging data from CT and PET in combination with anthropomorphic information like gender, age, body weight and height and used for the evaluation of quantitative liver function tests in a personalized context. \n\n\nASSAYS\nGalactose Modelling\nDATA_FILES\ncy3sabiork-SupplementaryFile-S1\ncy3sabiork-SupplementaryFile-S2\nINSTITUTIONS\nHumboldt-Universität zu Berlin\nCharité University Medicine Berlin\nHumboldt University Berlin\nINVESTIGATIONS\nTools and standards for computational modeling in biology\nMM-PLF: Multiscale modeling for personalized liver function\nMODELS\nHepatic galactose model\nPRESENTATIONS\nManagement of data, models, analyses and code for reproducible computational research: Present and Future\nPAL report – Data management LiSyM Multiscale Models for Liver Function Tests\nPROJECTS\nMulti-Scale Models for Personalized Liver Function Tests (LiSyM-MM-PLF)\nKinetics on the move - Workshop 2016\nFAIRDOM user meeting\nCOMBINE Multicellular Modelling\nFAIRDOM & LiSyM & de.NBI Data Structuring Training\nPUBLICATIONS\ncy3sabiork: A Cytoscape app for visualizing kinetic data from SABIO-RK\nToward community standards and software for whole-cell modeling\nHarmonizing semantic annotations for computational models in biology\nSTUDIES\nA Multiscale Computational Model of Human Galactose Metabolism\nHuman Caffeine Metabolism\n\n________________________________________________________\n\nThomas Hankemeier(id: 1248 | type: people)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nINSTITUTIONS\nUniversity of Leiden\nPROJECTS\nPoLiMeR -   Polymers in the Liver: Metabolism and Regulation\n\n________________________________________________________\n\nMorpheus: open source modelling and simulation framework for multicellular systems(id: 320 | type: models)\n\nDescription: Morpheus is the modelling and simulation framework for multicellular systems biology developed at Technische Universität Dresden.\r\nManual, examples and binaries for Windows, Linux, MacOS at: https://imc.zih.tu-dresden.de/wiki/morpheus\r\nOpen source code at: https://gitlab.com/morpheus.lab/morpheus\n\n\nCREATORS\nLutz Brusch\nPEOPLE\nLutz Brusch\nPROJECTS\nEarly Metabolic Injury (LiSyM-EMI - Pillar I)\nPUBLICATIONS\nMorpheus: a user-friendly modeling environment for multiscale and multicellular systems biology.\nA Predictive 3D Multi-Scale Model of Biliary Fluid Dynamics in the Liver Lobule.\nSUBMITTER\nLutz Brusch\n\n________________________________________________________\n\nSysMO-DB - Progress update and future activities(id: 38 | type: presentations)\n\nDescription: Carole Goble's presentation at the SysMO Evaluation conference in Tenerife - May 2012.\n\n\nCREATORS\nCarole Goble\nPEOPLE\nCarole Goble\nStuart Owen\nPROJECTS\nSysMO DB\nSUBMITTER\nStuart Owen\n\n________________________________________________________\n\nIf we build it will they come?(id: 42 | type: presentations)\n\nDescription: Keynote presentation by Professor Carole Goble at BOSC (Bioinformatics Open Source Conference) Long Beach, California, USA, July 14 2012.

We report a multiscale mathematical model of the Human liver comprising the scales from single hepatocytes, over representation of ultra-structure and micro-circulation in the hepatic tissue, up to the entire organ integrated with perfusion. The model was validated against data on multiple spatial and temporal scales. Herein we describe the model construction and application to hepatic galactose metabolism demonstrating its utility via i) the personalization of liver function tests based on galactose elimination capacity (GEC), ii) the explanation of changes in liver function with aging, and iii) the prediction of population variability in liver function based on variability in liver volume and perfusion. We conclude that physiology- and morphology-based multiscale models can improve the evaluation of individual liver function. \r\n\r\nAvailability: Personalized prediction of liver function (GEC) was implemented in a proof-of-principle app available at https://www.livermetabolism.com/gec_app/.

An understanding of mechanisms that facilitate the physiological shift towards a proliferative metabolism in cancer cells is considered a major upcoming topic in oncology and is a key activity for future drug development. Due to the complexity of interrelations, a systems biology approach would be most suited. However, rarely a systems biology approach is taken that: (i) works at standard conditions, (ii) combines modelling and quantitative data generation on metabolism and signalling, (iii) considers primary healthy and cancerous cells, and (iv) addresses patient heterogeneity. This project covers all these aspects. It is therefore timely, highly innovative and demonstrates the potential of systems biology towards an application in oncology. \r\n\r\nKey questions:\r\nWhich isoforms of glycolytic enzymes and key signalling components are relevant in hepatocytes and hepatoma cells?\r\n\r\nHow does growth factor and inflammatory signalling affect glycolysis in hepatocytes and hepatoma cells?\r\n\r\nCan we design strategies for combinatorial interventions of metabolism and signal transduction to inhibit proliferation of cancer cells but not affecting healthy cells?\r\n\r\n\n\n\nINSTITUTIONS\nVU University Amsterdam\nChalmers University of Technology\nUniversity of Freiburg\nGerman Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)\nCharité University Medicine Berlin\nGriffin Discoveries BV\nUniversitätsklinikum Leipzig\nORGANISMS\nHomo sapiens\nPEOPLE\nBas Teusink\nJens Nielsen\nJurgen  Haanstra\nFrank Bruggerman\nUrsula Klingmüller\nDaniel Seehofer\nJens Timmer\nIwan De Esch\nMarkus Stepath\nAdil Mardinoglu\nAvlant Nilsson\nGeorg Damm\nJoep Vanlier\nMelanie Kiessig\nIrina Titkova\nMartin Böhm\nGerda Schicht\nPROGRAMMES\nERASysAPP\n\n________________________________________________________\n\nliterature values for allosteric regulation of pyruvate kinase(id: 915 | type: data_files)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nCREATORS\nStefan Henrich\nPEOPLE\nStefan Henrich\nPROJECTS\nSysMO-LAB\nSUBMITTER\nStefan Henrich\n\n________________________________________________________\n\nPAL`s experience - IMOMESIC Project(id: 295 | type: presentations)\n\nDescription: Presented by Martin Böhm, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany\n\n\nCREATORS\nMarkus Stepath\nMartin Böhm\nEVENTS\nFirst FAIRDOM User Meeting held  as a satellite meeting of ICSB 2016 in Barcelona \nPEOPLE\nOlga Krebs\nMarkus Stepath\nMartin Böhm\nPROJECTS\nFAIRDOM\nFAIRDOM user meeting\nSUBMITTER\nOlga Krebs\n\n________________________________________________________\n\nCharité University Medicine Berlin(id: 96 | type: institutions)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nPEOPLE\nDaniel Seehofer\nGeorg Damm\nMelanie Kiessig\nMatthias König\nMarkus Morkel\nChristine Sers\nPamela Riemer\nCornelia Gieseler\nPROJECTS\nIMOMESIC\nMulti-Scale Models for Personalized Liver Function Tests (LiSyM-MM-PLF)\nKinetics on the move - Workshop 2016\nCausalDB\nColosys\nMESI-STRAT\n\n________________________________________________________\n\nBarbara Bakker(id: 335 | type: people)\n\nDescription: I am an Associate Professor in Systems Biology and the University Medical Centre Groningen. My research aims at understanding how energy metabolism is integrated and regulated. My work includes experimental, modelling as well as theoretical research. Recently I studied how metabolic regulation and gene-expression regulation work together towards in integrated response, e.g. when parasites are confronted with chemical inhibitors.

Anton is a leading researcher in skeletal muscle and integrative human physiology and metabolism with 185 peer reviewed journal publications and a Web of Science h-index of 50. His research is focussing on mechanisms by which impairments in fat metabolism lead to impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and muscle wasting (sarcopenia) in sedentary, obese, and elderly individuals, and on the design of optimal exercise/nutrition interventions that can be implemented in real life and reverse mechanisms that lead to development of the ageing phenotype and chronic disease. In these intervention studies the underlying molecular and physiological mechanisms are investigaetd as well. Anton is a leading expert in stable isotope methodology measuring glucose, fatty acid and protein kinetics in living human beings. Confocal immunohistochemical microscopy methods have been developed more recently to stain key enzymes playing a role in insulin resistance mechanisms in sections of skeletal muscle and its microvasculature to visualise the spatial distribution and co-localisation with membranes, mitochondria, lipid droplets and the endothelial layer of muscle arterioles and capillaries. This research has generated compelling evidence that insulin resistance occurs both in muscle fibers and their microvasculature. In obesity, metabolic syndrome and ageing insulin mediated dilation of the muscle microvasculature is impaired due to failure of insulin to activate eNOS (ser1177-P) and quenching of NO by superoxide anions (generated by NADPH oxidase). As a result of impaired arteriolar dilation the muscle fibres are starved of nutrients in well-fed bodies and meal derived glucose, lipids and amino acids are deposited in non-muscle tissues such as liver and adipose tissue. Anton was Editor for the Journal of Physiology (2007-14) and Chair of the Scientific Board of the European College of Sport Sciences (2007-15). Anton currently is Editor of the American Journal of Physiology - Endocrinology and Metabolism, and has a Web of Science h-index of 50. \r\n\n\n\nINSTITUTIONS\nLiverpool John Moores University\nPROJECTS\nHUMET Startup\n\n________________________________________________________\n\nLiSyM - Systems Medicine of the Liver(id: 9 | type: programmes)\n\nDescription: LiSyM (Liver Systems Medicine) represents a research network of German centers and institutions, brought together by a 20 Million Euro funding program of the German Government, in which mathematicians, modelers, pharmacologists, molecular biologists and clinical scientists work together to develop a Systems Medicine approach to study early and advanced liver disease.

Up until the turn of the millennium, farmed salmon were fed fish oil as a replacement for their omega-3 rich natural prey. However, fish oil is now a scarce resource, and more than half of the fat in modern feeds comes from plant oils that are inexpensive, but devoid of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids. How can we increase the omega-3 content of salmon on sustainable feeds?\r\n\r\nOne option is to breed salmon that are well adapted to the feeds of the future. There is heritable variation in salmon’s ability to build EPA and DHA from shorter omega-3 fatty acids. The DNA sequence of salmon is now well known, allowing rapid characterization of heritable differences in nutrient utilization. A salmon family that appears promising on one feed, may not be the best on another. Therefore, we need to understand the salmon’s body as a system: a functional whole made up of parts that mutually affect, but also depend on, each other. A systems understanding of the interplay between feed and genetic factors will allow a tailoring of fish to feed and vice versa, which is robust to fluctuations in feedstuff availability and pricing.\r\n\r\nAs a first step towards such a systems understanding, the GenoSysFat project involves two biological experiments. 1) A traditional feeding experiment using high- vs low-omega-3 diets and salmon families that differ in feed utilization. 2) A novel study with pieces of liver kept alive and “fed” in laboratory dishes, studying for each fish how different feeds affect metabolism and gene activity.

Libraries were sequenced at the Norwegian Sequencing Centre (NSC). All libraries were pooled, and the same pool was sequenced on 4 flow cell lanes on a HiSeq 3000 machine (Illumina), generating 100bp single-end reads. \nRNA sequencing files (.fastq) were processed in the following manner: (i) All reads from the same individual were merged into one fastq file. (ii) Reads were mapped to the Atlantic salmon genome (GenBank Accession number: GCA_0002333375.4) using STAR (v 2.6.0c) 50. (iii) Read alignments, recorded in BAM format were subsequently used to count uniquely mapped reads per gene using featurecounts (v1.4.4) 51, with the RefSeq gene_ids. Raw illumina reads as well as gene counts are publicly available through ArrayExpress 52 accession E-MTAB-7220.  \n\n\nCREATORS\nSahar Hassani\nDATA_FILES\nCombined.counts\nCrispr_metadata\nPEOPLE\nSahar Hassani\nPROJECTS\nDigiSal\nSTUDY\nELOVL2 Knockout\nSUBMITTER\nSahar Hassani\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nMM-PLF: Multiscale modeling for personalized liver function(id: 96 | type: investigations)\n\nDescription: Understanding how liver function arises from the complex interaction of morphology, perfusion, and metabolism from single cells up to the entire organ requires systems-levels computational approaches.\n\n\n\nASSAYS\nGalactose Modelling\nCREATORS\nMatthias König\nMODELS\nHepatic galactose model\nPEOPLE\nMatthias König\nPROJECTS\nMulti-Scale Models for Personalized Liver Function Tests (LiSyM-MM-PLF)\nSTUDIES\nA Multiscale Computational Model of Human Galactose Metabolism\nHuman Caffeine Metabolism\nSUBMITTER\nMatthias König\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nToward community standards and software for whole-cell modeling(id: 267 | type: publications)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nINVESTIGATIONS\nTools and standards for computational modeling in biology\nPEOPLE\nMatthias König\nPROJECTS\nMulti-Scale Models for Personalized Liver Function Tests (LiSyM-MM-PLF)\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nIceni Diagnostics Ltd(id: 260 | type: institutions)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nPEOPLE\nStephan Goetz\nPROJECTS\nPoLiMeR -

Hands-on sessions, lectures and software demonstrations will provide attendees with the necessary skills to apply components of the FAIRDOM infrastructure in their daily work for interrelating and exchanging data, models and corresponding information.\n\nFAIRDOM is a research infrastructure offering data management support. The SEEK software is designed as registry and storage place for data, models, biological samples, processes, publications and presentations, and at the same time as yellow pages for projects, people and events. SEEK is implemented as central data management platform in research networks such as LiSyM (https://seek.lisym.org), but also as cross-project platform FAIRDOMhub (https://www.fairdomhub.org) used e.g. by the European ERASysAPP initiative. The tutorial is jointly organized by LiSyM, ERASysAPP and the the German Network for Bioinformatics Infrastructure (de.NBI).\n\nParticipants need to bring their own laptop.\n\n\nPRESENTATIONS\nFAIRDOM tutorial workshop SBMC2018 Bremen -

ITNs bring together universities, research institutes, industry and clinical partners from across the world to train researchers to doctorate level.\n\nMetabolic diseases are a burden on the European population and health care system. It is increasingly recognised that individual differences with respect to history, lifestyle, and genetic make-up affect disease progression and treatment response. A Systems Medicine approach, based on computational models fed with individual patient data, has the potential to provide the basis for a personalised diagnosis and treatment strategy. The PoLiMeR consortium (Polymers in the Liver: Metabolism and Regulation) has identified the inherited, liver-related diseases of glycogen and lipid metabolism as the ideal starting point for innovative research training in personalised ‘Systems Medicine'.\n\n\nINSTITUTIONS\nHeidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies (HITS gGmbH)\nUniversity of Bergen\nUniversity of Duesseldorf\nUniversity of Groningen\nUniversity of Leiden\nChalmers University of Technology\nUniversity of Freiburg\nUniversity of Luxembourg\nIceni Diagnostics Ltd\nJohn Innes Centre\nMimetas\nORGANISMS\nHomo sapiens\nPEOPLE\nOlga Krebs\nWolfgang Müller\nBarbara Bakker\nAdil Mardinoglu\nInes Thiele\nKathrin Thedieck\nMathias Ziegler\nKaren Van Eunen\nMaaike H.

The quantification of these liver functions is essential to assess the status of the liver, obtain information about the degree of impairment, to evaluate treatment response or to select transplant recipients.\n\nWithin the Systems Medicine of the Liver (LiSyM) consortium we establish a standardized multiscale model framework of the human liver readily adaptable to various quantitative liver function tests currently used in the clinics. The resulting models will be personalized with individual imaging data from CT and PET in combination with anthropomorphic information like gender, age, body weight and height and used for the evaluation of quantitative liver function tests in a personalized context. \n\n\nASSAYS\nGalactose Modelling\nDATA_FILES\ncy3sabiork-SupplementaryFile-S1\ncy3sabiork-SupplementaryFile-S2\nINSTITUTIONS\nHumboldt-Universität zu Berlin\nCharité University Medicine Berlin\nHumboldt University Berlin\nINVESTIGATIONS\nTools and standards for computational modeling in biology\nMM-PLF: Multiscale modeling for personalized liver function\nMODELS\nHepatic galactose model\nPRESENTATIONS\nManagement of data, models, analyses and code for reproducible computational research: Present and Future\nPAL report – Data management LiSyM Multiscale Models for Liver Function Tests\nPROJECTS\nMulti-Scale Models for Personalized Liver Function Tests (LiSyM-MM-PLF)\nKinetics on the move - Workshop 2016\nFAIRDOM user meeting\nCOMBINE Multicellular Modelling\nFAIRDOM & LiSyM & de.NBI Data Structuring Training\nPUBLICATIONS\ncy3sabiork: A Cytoscape app for visualizing kinetic data from SABIO-RK\nToward community standards and software for whole-cell modeling\nHarmonizing semantic annotations for computational models in biology\nSTUDIES\nA Multiscale Computational Model of Human Galactose Metabolism\nHuman Caffeine Metabolism\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nTerry G.J.

We report a multiscale mathematical model of the Human liver comprising the scales from single hepatocytes, over representation of ultra-structure and micro-circulation in the hepatic tissue, up to the entire organ integrated with perfusion. The model was validated against data on multiple spatial and temporal scales. Herein we describe the model construction and application to hepatic galactose metabolism demonstrating its utility via i) the personalization of liver function tests based on galactose elimination capacity (GEC), ii) the explanation of changes in liver function with aging, and iii) the prediction of population variability in liver function based on variability in liver volume and perfusion. We conclude that physiology- and morphology-based multiscale models can improve the evaluation of individual liver function. \n\nAvailability: Personalized prediction of liver function (GEC) was implemented in a proof-of-principle app available at https://www.livermetabolism.com/gec_app/.

My research aims at understanding how energy metabolism is integrated and regulated. My work includes experimental, modelling as well as theoretical research. Recently I studied how metabolic regulation and gene-expression regulation work together towards in integrated response, e.g. when parasites are confronted with chemical inhibitors. Much of my work has been about the regulation of glycolysis and its various modes of action (steady-state, oscillations, turbo explosion).\nMy current research deals with the integration of different metabolic pathways. Research lines include:\n- Switching between lipids and carbohydrates and how this is affected in various metabolic diseases;\n- The relation between metabolism and biologial ageing;\n- The integration of redox and energy metabolism in African trypanosomes (SysMO project).\n\n\nINSTITUTIONS\nUniversity of Groningen\nMODELS\nModel of Trypanosoma brucei glycolysis as published in Achcar et al.

An understanding of mechanisms that facilitate the physiological shift towards a proliferative metabolism in cancer cells is considered a major upcoming topic in oncology and is a key activity for future drug development. Due to the complexity of interrelations, a systems biology approach would be most suited. However, rarely a systems biology approach is taken that: (i) works at standard conditions, (ii) combines modelling and quantitative data generation on metabolism and signalling, (iii) considers primary healthy and cancerous cells, and (iv) addresses patient heterogeneity. This project covers all these aspects. It is therefore timely, highly innovative and demonstrates the potential of systems biology towards an application in oncology. \n\nKey questions:\nWhich isoforms of glycolytic enzymes and key signalling components are relevant in hepatocytes and hepatoma cells?\n\nHow does growth factor and inflammatory signalling affect glycolysis in hepatocytes and hepatoma cells?\n\nCan we design strategies for combinatorial interventions of metabolism and signal transduction to inhibit proliferation of cancer cells but not affecting healthy cells?\n\n\n\n\nINSTITUTIONS\nVU University Amsterdam\nChalmers University of Technology\nUniversity of Freiburg\nGerman Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)\nCharité University Medicine Berlin\nGriffin Discoveries BV\nUniversitätsklinikum Leipzig\nORGANISMS\nHomo sapiens\nPEOPLE\nBas Teusink\nJens Nielsen\nJurgen  Haanstra\nFrank Bruggerman\nUrsula Klingmüller\nDaniel Seehofer\nJens Timmer\nIwan De Esch\nMarkus Stepath\nAdil Mardinoglu\nAvlant Nilsson\nGeorg Damm\nJoep Vanlier\nMelanie Kiessig\nIrina Titkova\nMartin Böhm\nGerda Schicht\nPROGRAMMES\nERASysAPP\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCharité University Medicine Berlin(id: 96 | type: institutions)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nPEOPLE\nDaniel Seehofer\nGeorg Damm\nMelanie Kiessig\nMatthias König\nMarkus Morkel\nChristine Sers\nPamela Riemer\nCornelia Gieseler\nPROJECTS\nIMOMESIC\nMulti-Scale Models for Personalized Liver Function Tests (LiSyM-MM-PLF)\nKinetics on the move - Workshop 2016\nCausalDB\nColosys\nMESI-STRAT\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\n1st LiSyM Jamboree & SAB Meeting(id: 73 | type: events)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nPROJECTS\nEarly Metabolic Injury (LiSyM-EMI - Pillar I)\nChronic Liver Disease Progression (LiSyM-DP - Pillar II)\nRegeneration and Repair in Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (LiSyM-ACLF - Pillar III)\nLiSyM Core Infrastructure and Management (LiSyM-PD)\nLiver Function Diagnostics (LiSyM-LiFuDi - Pillar IV)\nModel Guided Pharmacotherapy In Chronic Liver Disease (LiSyM-MGP)\nMulti-Scale Models for Personalized Liver Function Tests (LiSyM-MM-PLF)\nThe Hedgehog Signalling Pathway (LiSyM-JGMMS)\nMolecular Steatosis - Imaging & Modeling (LiSyM-MSIM)\nSUBMITTER\nMartin Golebiewski\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nSABIO-RK results for hands on training(id: 2145 | type: data_files)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nCREATORS\nMaja Rey\nUlrike Wittig\nEVENTS\nTools for systems biology modeling and data exchange 2018\nPEOPLE\nMaja Rey\nUlrike Wittig\nPROJECTS\nde.NBI-SysBio\nSUBMITTER\nMaja Rey\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nProteomics Template from PRIDE(id: 9 | type: data_files)\n\nDescription: An example of a completed data sheet for Mass spectrometry data.

Anton is a leading researcher in skeletal muscle and integrative human physiology and metabolism with 185 peer reviewed journal publications and a Web of Science h-index of 50. His research is focussing on mechanisms by which impairments in fat metabolism lead to impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and muscle wasting (sarcopenia) in sedentary, obese, and elderly individuals, and on the design of optimal exercise/nutrition interventions that can be implemented in real life and reverse mechanisms that lead to development of the ageing phenotype and chronic disease. In these intervention studies the underlying molecular and physiological mechanisms are investigaetd as well. Anton is a leading expert in stable isotope methodology measuring glucose, fatty acid and protein kinetics in living human beings. Confocal immunohistochemical microscopy methods have been developed more recently to stain key enzymes playing a role in insulin resistance mechanisms in sections of skeletal muscle and its microvasculature to visualise the spatial distribution and co-localisation with membranes, mitochondria, lipid droplets and the endothelial layer of muscle arterioles and capillaries. This research has generated compelling evidence that insulin resistance occurs both in muscle fibers and their microvasculature. In obesity, metabolic syndrome and ageing insulin mediated dilation of the muscle microvasculature is impaired due to failure of insulin to activate eNOS (ser1177-P) and quenching of NO by superoxide anions (generated by NADPH oxidase). As a result of impaired arteriolar dilation the muscle fibres are starved of nutrients in well-fed bodies and meal derived glucose, lipids and amino acids are deposited in non-muscle tissues such as liver and adipose tissue. Anton was Editor for the Journal of Physiology (2007-14) and Chair of the Scientific Board of the European College of Sport Sciences (2007-15). Anton currently is Editor of the American Journal of Physiology - Endocrinology and Metabolism, and has a Web of Science h-index of 50. \r\n\n\n\nINSTITUTIONS\nLiverpool John Moores University\nPROJECTS\nHUMET Startup\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nUniversity of Bergen(id: 23 | type: institutions)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nPEOPLE\nNils-Kåre Birkeland\nAnita Elin-Fedoy\nInge Jonassen\nFatemeh Zamanzad Ghavidel\nFekadu Yadetie\nKarina Dale\nNello Blaser\nAnders Goksøyr\nXiaokang Zhang\nMorten Brun\nDorothy Dankel\nShirin Fallahi\nMathias Ziegler\nMarta Eide\nKidane Tekle\nSofie Söderström\nLibe Aranguren Abadía\nSiri Øfsthus Goksøyr\nOdd André Karlsen\nEileen Marie Hanna\nPROJECTS\nSulfoSys\nGenoSysFat\nDigiSal\nFAIRDOM user meeting\nSystems toxicology of Atlantic cod\nMESI-STRAT\nPoLiMeR -   Polymers in the Liver: Metabolism and Regulation\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nRightField presentation for Virtual Liver Network(id: 100 | type: presentations)\n\nDescription: Introduction to RightField and Demo were presented at the  Virtual Liver Network PALs meeting on 31st of October in Hünfeld, Germany\n\n\nCREATORS\nOlga Krebs\nStuart Owen\nKaty Wolstencroft\nPEOPLE\nKaty Wolstencroft\nStuart Owen\nOlga Krebs\nPROJECTS\nSysMO DB\nPUBLICATIONS\nRightField: embedding ontology annotation in spreadsheets\nSUBMITTER\nOlga Krebs\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nUniversity of Groningen(id: 35 | type: institutions)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nPEOPLE\nOscar Kuipers\nBert Poolman\nEriko Takano\nLubbert Dijkhuizen\nRainer Breitling\nArnold Driessen\nJacek Mika\nM.

Up until the turn of the millennium, farmed salmon were fed fish oil as a replacement for their omega-3 rich natural prey. However, fish oil is now a scarce resource, and more than half of the fat in modern feeds comes from plant oils that are inexpensive, but devoid of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids. How can we increase the omega-3 content of salmon on sustainable feeds?\r\n\r\nOne option is to breed salmon that are well adapted to the feeds of the future. There is heritable variation in salmon’s ability to build EPA and DHA from shorter omega-3 fatty acids. The DNA sequence of salmon is now well known, allowing rapid characterization of heritable differences in nutrient utilization. A salmon family that appears promising on one feed, may not be the best on another. Therefore, we need to understand the salmon’s body as a system: a functional whole made up of parts that mutually affect, but also depend on, each other. A systems understanding of the interplay between feed and genetic factors will allow a tailoring of fish to feed and vice versa, which is robust to fluctuations in feedstuff availability and pricing.\r\n\r\nAs a first step towards such a systems understanding, the GenoSysFat project involves two biological experiments. 1) A traditional feeding experiment using high- vs low-omega-3 diets and salmon families that differ in feed utilization. 2) A novel study with pieces of liver kept alive and “fed” in laboratory dishes, studying for each fish how different feeds affect metabolism and gene activity. This allows faster and more detailed exploration of the interplay between genetics and feeds. Results will be interpreted with the help of mathematical models for the biochemical reaction networks, which are well established for other species and will be adapted to salmon based on the newly sequenced salmon genome.\n\n\nDATA_FILES\nSalmon genome\nCombined taxonomy table from freshwater and saltwater samples\nINSTITUTIONS\nNorwegian University of Science and Technology\nUniversity of Bergen\nUniversity of Rostock\nWageningen University & Research\nNorwegian University of Life Sciences\nSchool of Computer Science, University of Manchester\nCargill\nORGANISMS\nDanio rerio\nSalmo salar\nOncorhynchus mykiss\nPEOPLE\nVitor Martins Dos Santos\nMaksim Zakhartsev\nStuart Owen\nNatalie Stanford\nJon Olav Vik\nArne Gjuvsland\nDagmar Waltemath\nSandve Simen\nGareth Gillard\nJacob Seilø Torgersen\nHanne Hellerud Hansen\nKristil  Sundsaasen\nFabian Grammes\nThomas Harvey\nGraceline Tina Kirubakaran\nLars Snipen\nDominic Nanton\nJesse Van Dam\nTorgeir R.

SEEK is implemented as central data management platform in research networks such as LiSyM (https://seek.lisym.org), but also as cross-project platform FAIRDOMhub (https://www.fairdomhub.org) used e.g. by the European ERASysAPP initiative. The tutorial is jointly organized by LiSyM, ERASysAPP and the the German Network for Bioinformatics Infrastructure (de.NBI).\n\nParticipants need to bring their own laptop.\n\n\nPRESENTATIONS\nFAIRDOM tutorial workshop SBMC2018 Bremen -

ITNs bring together universities, research institutes, industry and clinical partners from across the world to train researchers to doctorate level.\n\nMetabolic diseases are a burden on the European population and health care system. It is increasingly recognised that individual differences with respect to history, lifestyle, and genetic make-up affect disease progression and treatment response. A Systems Medicine approach, based on computational models fed with individual patient data, has the potential to provide the basis for a personalised diagnosis and treatment strategy. The PoLiMeR consortium (Polymers in the Liver: Metabolism and Regulation) has identified the inherited, liver-related diseases of glycogen and lipid metabolism as the ideal starting point for innovative research training in personalised ‘Systems Medicine'.\n\n\nINSTITUTIONS\nHeidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies (HITS gGmbH)\nUniversity of Bergen\nUniversity of Duesseldorf\nUniversity of Groningen\nUniversity of Leiden\nChalmers University of Technology\nUniversity of Freiburg\nUniversity of Luxembourg\nIceni Diagnostics Ltd\nJohn Innes Centre\nMimetas\nORGANISMS\nHomo sapiens\nPEOPLE\nOlga Krebs\nWolfgang Müller\nBarbara Bakker\nAdil Mardinoglu\nInes Thiele\nKathrin Thedieck\nMathias Ziegler\nKaren Van Eunen\nMaaike H.

The quantification of these liver functions is essential to assess the status of the liver, obtain information about the degree of impairment, to evaluate treatment response or to select transplant recipients.\n\nWithin the Systems Medicine of the Liver (LiSyM) consortium we establish a standardized multiscale model framework of the human liver readily adaptable to various quantitative liver function tests currently used in the clinics. The resulting models will be personalized with individual imaging data from CT and PET in combination with anthropomorphic information like gender, age, body weight and height and used for the evaluation of quantitative liver function tests in a personalized context. \n\n\nASSAYS\nGalactose Modelling\nDATA_FILES\ncy3sabiork-SupplementaryFile-S1\ncy3sabiork-SupplementaryFile-S2\nINSTITUTIONS\nHumboldt-Universität zu Berlin\nCharité University Medicine Berlin\nHumboldt University Berlin\nINVESTIGATIONS\nTools and standards for computational modeling in biology\nMM-PLF: Multiscale modeling for personalized liver function\nMODELS\nHepatic galactose model\nPRESENTATIONS\nManagement of data, models, analyses and code for reproducible computational research: Present and Future\nPAL report – Data management LiSyM Multiscale Models for Liver Function Tests\nPROJECTS\nMulti-Scale Models for Personalized Liver Function Tests (LiSyM-MM-PLF)\nKinetics on the move - Workshop 2016\nFAIRDOM user meeting\nCOMBINE Multicellular Modelling\nFAIRDOM & LiSyM & de.NBI Data Structuring Training\nPUBLICATIONS\ncy3sabiork: A Cytoscape app for visualizing kinetic data from SABIO-RK\nToward community standards and software for whole-cell modeling\nHarmonizing semantic annotations for computational models in biology\nSTUDIES\nA Multiscale Computational Model of Human Galactose Metabolism\nHuman Caffeine Metabolism\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nTerry G.J.

We report a multiscale mathematical model of the Human liver comprising the scales from single hepatocytes, over representation of ultra-structure and micro-circulation in the hepatic tissue, up to the entire organ integrated with perfusion. The model was validated against data on multiple spatial and temporal scales. Herein we describe the model construction and application to hepatic galactose metabolism demonstrating its utility via i) the personalization of liver function tests based on galactose elimination capacity (GEC), ii) the explanation of changes in liver function with aging, and iii) the prediction of population variability in liver function based on variability in liver volume and perfusion. We conclude that physiology- and morphology-based multiscale models can improve the evaluation of individual liver function. \n\nAvailability: Personalized prediction of liver function (GEC) was implemented in a proof-of-principle app available at https://www.livermetabolism.com/gec_app/.

An understanding of mechanisms that facilitate the physiological shift towards a proliferative metabolism in cancer cells is considered a major upcoming topic in oncology and is a key activity for future drug development. Due to the complexity of interrelations, a systems biology approach would be most suited. However, rarely a systems biology approach is taken that: (i) works at standard conditions, (ii) combines modelling and quantitative data generation on metabolism and signalling, (iii) considers primary healthy and cancerous cells, and (iv) addresses patient heterogeneity. This project covers all these aspects. It is therefore timely, highly innovative and demonstrates the potential of systems biology towards an application in oncology. \n\nKey questions:\nWhich isoforms of glycolytic enzymes and key signalling components are relevant in hepatocytes and hepatoma cells?\n\nHow does growth factor and inflammatory signalling affect glycolysis in hepatocytes and hepatoma cells?\n\nCan we design strategies for combinatorial interventions of metabolism and signal transduction to inhibit proliferation of cancer cells but not affecting healthy cells?\n\n\n\n\nINSTITUTIONS\nVU University Amsterdam\nChalmers University of Technology\nUniversity of Freiburg\nGerman Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)\nCharité University Medicine Berlin\nGriffin Discoveries BV\nUniversitätsklinikum Leipzig\nORGANISMS\nHomo sapiens\nPEOPLE\nBas Teusink\nJens Nielsen\nJurgen  Haanstra\nFrank Bruggerman\nUrsula Klingmüller\nDaniel Seehofer\nJens Timmer\nIwan De Esch\nMarkus Stepath\nAdil Mardinoglu\nAvlant Nilsson\nGeorg Damm\nJoep Vanlier\nMelanie Kiessig\nIrina Titkova\nMartin Böhm\nGerda Schicht\nPROGRAMMES\nERASysAPP\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nMartin Böhm(id: 700 | type: people)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nINSTITUTIONS\nGerman Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)\nPRESENTATIONS\nPAL`s experience - IMOMESIC Project\nPROJECTS\nIMOMESIC\nChronic Liver Disease Progression (LiSyM-DP - Pillar II)\nRegeneration and Repair in Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (LiSyM-ACLF - Pillar III)\nFAIRDOM user meeting\nPUBLICATIONS\nDivision of labor by dual feedback regulators controls JAK2/STAT5 signaling over broad ligand range\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nUniversity of Freiburg(id: 76 | type: institutions)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nPEOPLE\nJens Timmer\nMatthias Meier\nJoep Vanlier\nJohannes Bausch\nGeoffroy Andrieux\nMelanie Börries\nBernhard Steiert\nChristian Tönsing\nUte Spiekerkötter\nSara Tucci\nStefan Lenz\nPROJECTS\nIMOMESIC\nRootBook\nEarly Metabolic Injury (LiSyM-EMI - Pillar I)\nChronic Liver Disease Progression (LiSyM-DP - Pillar II)\nRegeneration and Repair in Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (LiSyM-ACLF - Pillar III)\nLiSyM Core Infrastructure and Management (LiSyM-PD)\nLiver Function Diagnostics (LiSyM-LiFuDi - Pillar IV)\nModel Guided Pharmacotherapy In Chronic Liver Disease (LiSyM-MGP)\nMulti-Scale Models for Personalized Liver Function Tests (LiSyM-MM-PLF)\nThe Hedgehog Signalling Pathway (LiSyM-JGMMS)\nMolecular Steatosis - Imaging & Modeling (LiSyM-MSIM)\nSBEpo - Systems Biology of Erythropoietin\nMS_DILI\nPoLiMeR -   Polymers in the Liver: Metabolism and Regulation\nGMDS Project Group \"FAIRe Dateninfrastrukturen für die Biomedizinische Informatik\"\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nJoint LiSyM & ERASysAPP Data Management PALs Meeting(id: 69 | type: events)\n\nDescription: This event is a jointly organized Data Management PALs Meeting that involves PALs from the German LiSyM (Liver Systems Medicine) network and from the ERASysAPP (ERA-Net for Systems Biology Applications) initiative.

Recently I studied how metabolic regulation and gene-expression regulation work together towards in integrated response, e.g. when parasites are confronted with chemical inhibitors. Much of my work has been about the regulation of glycolysis and its various modes of action (steady-state, oscillations, turbo explosion).\nMy current research deals with the integration of different metabolic pathways. Research lines include:\n- Switching between lipids and carbohydrates and how this is affected in various metabolic diseases;\n- The relation between metabolism and biologial ageing;\n- The integration of redox and energy metabolism in African trypanosomes (SysMO project).\n\n\nINSTITUTIONS\nUniversity of Groningen\nMODELS\nModel of Trypanosoma brucei glycolysis as published in Achcar et al.

Anton is a leading researcher in skeletal muscle and integrative human physiology and metabolism with 185 peer reviewed journal publications and a Web of Science h-index of 50. His research is focussing on mechanisms by which impairments in fat metabolism lead to impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and muscle wasting (sarcopenia) in sedentary, obese, and elderly individuals, and on the design of optimal exercise/nutrition interventions that can be implemented in real life and reverse mechanisms that lead to development of the ageing phenotype and chronic disease. In these intervention studies the underlying molecular and physiological mechanisms are investigaetd as well. Anton is a leading expert in stable isotope methodology measuring glucose, fatty acid and protein kinetics in living human beings. Confocal immunohistochemical microscopy methods have been developed more recently to stain key enzymes playing a role in insulin resistance mechanisms in sections of skeletal muscle and its microvasculature to visualise the spatial distribution and co-localisation with membranes, mitochondria, lipid droplets and the endothelial layer of muscle arterioles and capillaries. This research has generated compelling evidence that insulin resistance occurs both in muscle fibers and their microvasculature. In obesity, metabolic syndrome and ageing insulin mediated dilation of the muscle microvasculature is impaired due to failure of insulin to activate eNOS (ser1177-P) and quenching of NO by superoxide anions (generated by NADPH oxidase). As a result of impaired arteriolar dilation the muscle fibres are starved of nutrients in well-fed bodies and meal derived glucose, lipids and amino acids are deposited in non-muscle tissues such as liver and adipose tissue. Anton was Editor for the Journal of Physiology (2007-14) and Chair of the Scientific Board of the European College of Sport Sciences (2007-15). Anton currently is Editor of the American Journal of Physiology - Endocrinology and Metabolism, and has a Web of Science h-index of 50. \n\n\n\nINSTITUTIONS\nLiverpool John Moores University\nPROJECTS\nHUMET Startup\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nChemical analyses(id: 751 | type: assays)\n\nDescription: Chemical analyses in Kollevåg includes sediment contaminant concentrations, concentrations of various contaminants in cod liver and concentrations of PAH metabolites in cod bile.\n\n\nCREATORS\nKarina Dale\nDATA_FILES\nKollevåg biometrics\nPAH metabolites in bile Kollevåg\nSediment chemistry\nLiver chemistry_Kollevåg\nORGANISMS\nGadus morhua\nPEOPLE\nKarina Dale\nPROJECTS\nSystems toxicology of Atlantic cod\nSTUDY\nCaging study - Kollevåg\nSUBMITTER\nKarina Dale\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nModel Guided Pharmacotherapy In Chronic Liver Disease (LiSyM-MGP)(id: 45 | type: projects)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nDATA_FILES\nAgenda Data Structuring Course\nEVENTS\nFirst LiSyM PostDoc and PhD student retreat\nJoint LiSyM & ERASysAPP Data Management PALs Meeting\n1st LiSyM Jamboree & SAB Meeting\nFAIRDOM-LiSyM-de.NBI Data Structuring Course - Nov 22-23 - Hünfeld (D)\n7th Conference on Systems Biology of Mammalian Cells (SBMC 2018)\nLiSyM/de.NBI/ERASysAPP Tutorial: How to Share FAIR — The FAIRDOM Data and Model Management Practice\nINSTITUTIONS\nHeidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies (HITS gGmbH)\nUniversity of Freiburg\nLeibniz-Institut für Arbeitsforschung (IfADo)\nORGANISMS\nHomo sapiens\nMus musculus\nRattus norvegicus\nPEOPLE\nWolfgang Müller\nMartin Golebiewski\nJohannes Bausch\nAhmed Ghallab\nPRESENTATIONS\nFAIRDOM tutorial workshop SBMC2018 Bremen - Introduction\nPROGRAMMES\nLiSyM - Systems Medicine of the Liver\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nLiSyM - Systems Medicine of the Liver(id: 9 | type: programmes)\n\nDescription: LiSyM (Liver Systems Medicine) represents a research network of German centers and institutions, brought together by a 20 Million Euro funding program of the German Government, in which mathematicians, modelers, pharmacologists, molecular biologists and clinical scientists work together to develop a Systems Medicine approach to study early and advanced liver disease.

Up until the turn of the millennium, farmed salmon were fed fish oil as a replacement for their omega-3 rich natural prey. However, fish oil is now a scarce resource, and more than half of the fat in modern feeds comes from plant oils that are inexpensive, but devoid of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids. How can we increase the omega-3 content of salmon on sustainable feeds?\n\nOne option is to breed salmon that are well adapted to the feeds of the future. There is heritable variation in salmon’s ability to build EPA and DHA from shorter omega-3 fatty acids. The DNA sequence of salmon is now well known, allowing rapid characterization of heritable differences in nutrient utilization. A salmon family that appears promising on one feed, may not be the best on another. Therefore, we need to understand the salmon’s body as a system: a functional whole made up of parts that mutually affect, but also depend on, each other. A systems understanding of the interplay between feed and genetic factors will allow a tailoring of fish to feed and vice versa, which is robust to fluctuations in feedstuff availability and pricing.\n\nAs a first step towards such a systems understanding, the GenoSysFat project involves two biological experiments. 1) A traditional feeding experiment using high- vs low-omega-3 diets and salmon families that differ in feed utilization. 2) A novel study with pieces of liver kept alive and “fed” in laboratory dishes, studying for each fish how different feeds affect metabolism and gene activity. This allows faster and more detailed exploration of the interplay between genetics and feeds. Results will be interpreted with the help of mathematical models for the biochemical reaction networks, which are well established for other species and will be adapted to salmon based on the newly sequenced salmon genome.\n\n\nDATA_FILES\nSalmon genome\nCombined taxonomy table from freshwater and saltwater samples\nINSTITUTIONS\nNorwegian University of Science and Technology\nUniversity of Bergen\nUniversity of Rostock\nWageningen University & Research\nNorwegian University of Life Sciences\nSchool of Computer Science, University of Manchester\nCargill\nORGANISMS\nDanio rerio\nSalmo salar\nOncorhynchus mykiss\nPEOPLE\nVitor Martins Dos Santos\nMaksim Zakhartsev\nStuart Owen\nNatalie Stanford\nJon Olav Vik\nArne Gjuvsland\nDagmar Waltemath\nSandve Simen\nGareth Gillard\nJacob Seilø Torgersen\nHanne Hellerud Hansen\nKristil  Sundsaasen\nFabian Grammes\nThomas Harvey\nGraceline Tina Kirubakaran\nLars Snipen\nDominic Nanton\nJesse Van Dam\nTorgeir R.

Libraries were sequenced at the Norwegian Sequencing Centre (NSC). All libraries were pooled, and the same pool was sequenced on 4 flow cell lanes on a HiSeq 3000 machine (Illumina), generating 100bp single-end reads. \nRNA sequencing files (.fastq) were processed in the following manner: (i) All reads from the same individual were merged into one fastq file. (ii) Reads were mapped to the Atlantic salmon genome (GenBank Accession number: GCA_0002333375.4) using STAR (v 2.6.0c) 50. (iii) Read alignments, recorded in BAM format were subsequently used to count uniquely mapped reads per gene using featurecounts (v1.4.4) 51, with the RefSeq gene_ids.

He is WELBIO investigator and recipient of an ERC Starting Grant 2013 and a PoC ERC Grant 2016. He is laureate of the Baillet-Latour grant for medical research and the international prize of Physiology Lucien Dautrebande. His main research interests are the investigation of interactions between the gut microbiota, the host and specific biological systems such as the endocannabinoid system and the innate immune system in the context of obesity, type 2 diabetes and metabolic inflammation. In 2007, he published the discovery of the concept of metabolic endotoxemia, and in 2008 the first experimental evidence that gut barrier alteration contribute to metabolic alteration during obesity and diabetes. More recently, he discovered the beneficial role of the bacteria Akkermansia muciniphila on obesity and cardiometabolic risk factors, and isolated active metabolic compounds from this bacteria. He is author and co-author of more than 170 scientific research publications, member of several international associations; he is member of the Royal Belgian Academy of Sciences.\n\n\nINSTITUTIONS\nUniversité catholique de Louvain\nPROJECTS\nHUMET Startup\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nModelling sustained glycolytic oscillations in individual isolated yeast cells (Gustavsson models)(id: 218 | type: assays)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nINVESTIGATION\nYeast Glycolytic Oscillations\nMODELS\nSustained glycolytic oscillations in individual isolated yeast cells - IV\nSustained glycolytic oscillations in individual isolated yeast cells - III\nSustained glycolytic oscillations in individual isolated yeast cells - II\nSustained glycolytic oscillations in individual isolated yeast cells - I\nPEOPLE\nKaty Wolstencroft\nPROJECTS\nSysMO DB\nPUBLICATIONS\nSustained glycolytic oscillations in individual isolated yeast cells\nFrom steady-state to synchronized yeast glycolytic oscillations II: model validation\nFrom steady-state to synchronized yeast glycolytic oscillations I: model construction\nSTUDY\nSustained glycolytic oscillations in individual isolated yeast cells\nSUBMITTER\nKaty Wolstencroft\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nData table with cell counts (combined both rounds of analysis)(id: 1435 | type: data_files)\n\nDescription: just cell counts, the area of the grains is separate.\n\n\nCREATORS\nAntoine Buetti-Dinh\nPEOPLE\nAntoine Buetti-Dinh\nSUBMITTER\nAntoine Buetti-Dinh\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nlist of publications 2006 - 2016(id: 1461 | type: data_files)\n\nDescription: List of publications from 2006 till 2016. \nNote: I retired from the University of Amsterdam in 2010\n\n\nCREATORS\nRoel Van Driel\nPEOPLE\nRoel Van Driel\nPROJECTS\nHUMET Startup\nSUBMITTER\nRoel Van Driel\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nProteome of Clostridium acetobutylicum growing at steady-state pH 5.5 to pH 4.7(id: 836 | type: data_files)\n\nDescription: Representation of all prepared 2D PAGE analyses of cytosolic proteins of Clostridium acetobutylicum growing continuously at pH 5.5, 5.3, 5.1, 4.9 and 4.7.\n\n\n\nASSAYS\nComparison of the proteome between pH 5.7 (acidogenesis) and pH 4.5 (solventogenesis).\nCREATORS\nHolger Janssen\nINVESTIGATIONS\nThe effect of pH upon the metabolic shift in Clostridium acetobutylicum in continuous culture.\nPEOPLE\nHolger Janssen\nPROJECTS\nCOSMIC\nPUBLICATIONS\nIntegrative modelling of pH-dependent enzyme activity and transcriptomic regulation of the acetone-butanol-ethanol fermentation of\n              Clostridium acetobutylicum\n              in continuous culture\nSTUDIES\nEffect of pH on the proteome\nSUBMITTER\nHolger Janssen\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nLactobacillus plantarum JDM1 protein list(id: 1064 | type: data_files)\n\nDescription: Lactobacillus plantarum JDM1 differentially expressed proteins, comparison between low and high growth rates\n\n\nCREATORS\nAnette McLeod\nPEOPLE\nAnette McLeod\nPROJECTS\nSysMO-LAB\nSUBMITTER\nAnette McLeod\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nProteomics Template (empty) from PRIDE(id: 10 | type: data_files)\n\nDescription: An example of a blank data sheet for Mass spectrometry data.

In this solution, (i) the ratio photorespiration / photosynthesis has been fixed to 0.25; (ii) and ATP transport between plastid and cytoplasm has been set to 0. The last constraint allows finding the ratio between fluxes through FQR (ferredoxin-plastoquinone reductase) and FRN (ferredoxin-NADP oxidoreductase) under which the ATP balance in plastid becomes self-sufficient (due to cyclic electron flux through FQR), correspondingly plastid neither imports nor exports ATP to/from cytoplasm. Flux through FQR represents cyclic electron flow through the light photosynthesis system. Flux through FRN represents non-cyclic electron flow through the light photosynthesis system. \n\n\nASSAYS\nFlux Balance Analysis of multi-compartment metabolic model of growing Arabidopsis thaliana\nCREATORS\nMaksim Zakhartsev\nINVESTIGATIONS\nMetabolic analysis of effects of sucrose translocation on phenotypic traits of Arabidopsis thaliana\nPEOPLE\nMaksim Zakhartsev\nPROJECTS\nZucAt\nSTUDIES\nAnalysis of central carbon and energy metabolisms of growing Arabidopsis thaliana in relation to sucrose translocation\nSUBMITTER\nMaksim Zakhartsev\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nEntire transcriptional dataset - anaerobic to aerobic .csv(id: 47 | type: data_files)\n\nDescription: This .csv file contains the entire transcriptional dataset of the anaerobic to aerobic transition.

Using a detailed kinetic model for the cellular reactions, we simulated the heterogeneity in the response of the individual cells, assuming small differences in a single internal parameter. By operating at two different flow rates per experiment, we observe four of categories of cell behaviour. The present model (gustavsson4) predicts the steady-state behaviour observed in 25.7% of the cell population. \n\n\nASSAYS\nModelling sustained glycolytic oscillations in individual isolated yeast cells (Gustavsson models)\nCREATORS\nFranco Du Preez\nJacky Snoep\nDawie Van Niekerk\nINVESTIGATIONS\nYeast Glycolytic Oscillations\nPEOPLE\nJacky Snoep\nFranco Du Preez\nDawie Van Niekerk\nPROJECTS\nSysMO DB\nPUBLICATIONS\nSustained glycolytic oscillations in individual isolated yeast cells\nFrom steady-state to synchronized yeast glycolytic oscillations II: model validation\nFrom steady-state to synchronized yeast glycolytic oscillations I: model construction\nSTUDIES\nSustained glycolytic oscillations in individual isolated yeast cells\nSUBMITTER\nFranco Du Preez\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nSalazar2009_FloweringPhotoperiod - PLM_9, version 1(id: 886 | type: assays)\n\nDescription: \tThe model shows how the <em>CONSTANS</em> gene and protein in <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em> forms a day-length sensor.

To ensure that simulations show the stable phase under any light:dark cycle, the model should be run for 720 hours (30 days) before evaluating its behaviour in light:dark cycles.

CcpA in a complex with HPr-Ser-P (seryl-phosphorylated form of histidine-containing protein, HPr) binds to operator sites called catabolite responsive elements, cre. Depending on the cre box position relative to the promoter, the CcpA/HPr-Ser-P complex can either act as a positive or a negative regulator. The cre boxes are highly degenerate semi-palindromes with a lowly conserved consensus sequence. So far, studies aimed at revealing how CcpA can bind such diverse sites were focused on the analysis of single cre boxes. In this study, a genome-wide analysis of cre sites was performed in order to identify differences in cre sequence and position, which determine their binding affinity.\nThe transcriptomes of B. subtilis cultures with three different CcpA expression levels were compared. The higher the amount of CcpA in the cells, the more operons possessing cre sites were differentially regulated. The cre boxes that mediated regulation at low CcpA levels were designated as strong (high affinity) and those which responded only to high amounts of CcpA, as weak (low affinity). Differences in the sequence and position in relation to the transcription start site between strong and weak cre boxes were revealed.\nCertain residues at specific positions in the cre box as well as, to a certain extent, a more palindromic nature of cre sequences and the location of cre in close vicinity to the transcription start site contribute to the strength of CcpA-dependent regulation. The main factors contributing to cre regulatory efficiencies, enabling subtle differential control of various subregulons of the CcpA regulon, are identified.\n\n\nCREATORS\nOscar Kuipers\nPEOPLE\nOscar Kuipers\nLeif Steil\nPROJECTS\nBaCell-SysMO\nPUBLICATIONS\nHigh- and low-affinity cre boxes for CcpA binding in Bacillus subtilis revealed by genome-wide analysis\nSUBMITTER\nLeif Steil\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nStandard operating procedure to analyze the intracellular proteome of Clostridium acetobutylicum.(id: 147 | type: sops)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nASSAYS\nComparison of the proteome between pH 5.7 (acidogenesis) and pH 4.5 (solventogenesis).\nCREATORS\nHolger Janssen\nTomas Fiedler\nINVESTIGATIONS\nThe effect of pH upon the metabolic shift in Clostridium acetobutylicum in continuous culture.\nPEOPLE\nTomas Fiedler\nHolger Janssen\nPROJECTS\nCOSMIC\nSTUDIES\nEffect of pH on the proteome\nSUBMITTER\nHolger Janssen\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nGenome-wide gene expression analysis of the switch between acidogenesis and solventogenesis in continuous cultures of Clostridium acetobutylicum(id: 142 | type: publications)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nMODELS\nModel of the pH-induced metabolic shift in phosphate-limited continuous cultures of C. acetobutylicum assuming a phenotypic switch\nPEOPLE\nArmin Ehrenreich\nHubert Bahl\nPeter Dürre\nRalf-Jörg Fischer\nThomas Millat\nDésireé Krausse\nHolger Janssen\nPRESENTATIONS\nThe pH-induced metabolic shift from acidogenesis to solventogenesis in Clostridium acetobutylicum - From experiments to models\nPROJECTS\nCOSMIC\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nMorpheus model of spatio-temporal Smo regulation in response to Hh signaling(id: 321 | type: models)\n\nDescription: \n\nThe model is adapted from A.P.

Due to this new insight the number of single cell studies rises continuously (for recent reviews see (1,2,3)). However, many of the single cell techniques applied do not allow monitoring the development and behavior of one specific single cell in time (e.g. flow cytometry or standard microscopy). Here, we provide a detailed description of a microscopy method used in several recent studies (4, 5, 6, 7), which allows following and recording (fluorescence of) individual bacterial cells of Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus pneumoniae through growth and division for many generations. The resulting movies can be used to construct phylogenetic lineage trees by tracing back the history of a single cell within a population that originated from one common ancestor. This time-lapse fluorescence microscopy method cannot only be used to investigate growth, division and differentiation of individual cells, but also to analyze the effect of cell history and ancestry on specific cellular behavior. Furthermore, time-lapse microscopy is ideally suited to examine gene expression dynamics and protein localization during the bacterial cell cycle. The method explains how to prepare the bacterial cells and construct the microscope slide to enable the outgrowth of single cells into a microcolony. In short, single cells are spotted on a semi-solid surface consisting of growth medium supplemented with agarose on which they grow and divide under a fluorescence microscope within a temperature controlled environmental chamber. Images are captured at specific intervals and are later analyzed using the open source software ImageJ.\n\n\nASSAYS\nLive Cell Imaging of Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus pneumoniae using Automated Time-lapse Microscopy.\nINVESTIGATION\nWetlab approach to transcription fidelity\nPEOPLE\nJan-Willem Veening\nPROJECTS\nNoisy-Strep\nPUBLICATIONS\nSMC is recruited to oriC by ParB and promotes chromosome segregation in Streptococcus pneumoniae\nLive Cell Imaging of <em>Bacillus subtilis</em> and <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> using Automated Time-lapse Microscopy\nControl of cell division in Streptococcus pneumoniae by the conserved Ser/Thr protein kinase StkP\nSingle cell analysis of gene expression patterns during carbon starvation in Bacillus subtilis reveals large phenotypic variation\nSUBMITTER\nJan-Willem Veening\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nAlison Graham(id: 198 | type: people)\n\nDescription: Post-doctoral research associate working in Sheffield in the SUMO consortium.\n\n\nASSAYS\nMeasurement of cytochrome numbers\nINSTITUTIONS\nUniversity of Sheffield\nPROJECTS\nSUMO\nPUBLICATIONS\nTranscript profiling and inference of Escherichia coli K-12 ArcA activity across the range of physiologically relevant oxygen concentrations\nModelling complex biological systems using an agent-based approach\nSOPS\nSimons method for making monolysogenic lacZ operon fusions on the E. coli chromosome\nQuantifying cytochromes\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nUniversity of Newcastle(id: 44 | type: institutions)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nPEOPLE\nColin Harwood\nJoseph Newman\nHenrik Strahl Von Schulten\nLeendert Hamoen\nRick Lewis\nNikolay Zenkin\nYulia Yuzenkova\nCiaran Welsh\nDaryl Shanley\nKrutik Patel\nHannah O'Keefe\nAlvaro Martinez Guimera\nJames Wordsworth\nPROJECTS\nBaCell-SysMO\nNoisy-Strep\nICYSB 2015 - International Practical Course in Systems Biology\nMESI-STRAT\nSystems modelling age-related changes in the maintenance of dermal extra-cellular matrix: mechanisms and interventions\nAre microRNAs key mediators of cartilage destruction in osteoarthritis?\nDynamic interplay between nuclei and mitochondria in ageing cells\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nRaju Prasad Sharma(id: 905 | type: people)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nINSTITUTIONS\nVU University Amsterdam\nUniversitat Rovira i Virgili\nPROJECTS\nService to URV Tarragona, Spain with respect to their Safety Assessment of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals model (Active NOW)\nEraCoBiotech 2 nd call proposal preparation\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nRegulation of Trk-dependent potassium transport by the calcineurin pathway involves the Hal5 kinase(id: 24 | type: publications)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nPEOPLE\nJoaquin Ariño\nJose Ramos\nFalko Krause\nPROJECTS\nTRANSLUCENT\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nSEEK: Systems Biology Data and Models Sharing(id: 35 | type: presentations)\n\nDescription: An overview of the SEEK for the HCLS Systems Biology Task force meeting\n\n\nCREATORS\nKaty Wolstencroft\nStuart Owen\nPEOPLE\nKaty Wolstencroft\nStuart Owen\nPROJECTS\nSysMO DB\nSUBMITTER\nKaty Wolstencroft\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nRole of phosphate in the central metabolism of two lactic acid bacteria - a comparative systems biology approach(id: 136 | type: publications)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nMODELS\nPublished kinetic model of glycolysis in L. lactis\nPublished kinetic model of glycolysis in S. pyogenes\nPEOPLE\nWillem De Vos\nBas Teusink\nBernd Kreikemeyer\nJeroen Hugenholtz\nMark Musters\nMartijn Bekker\nTomas Fiedler\nUrsula Kummer\nJennifer Levering\nDomenico Bellomo\nPROJECTS\nSysMO-LAB\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nMorpheus: a user-friendly modeling environment for multiscale and multicellular systems biology.(id: 365 | type: publications)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nMODELS\nMorpheus: open source modelling and simulation framework for multicellular systems\nMorpheus model of spatio-temporal Smo regulation in response to Hh signaling\nSpatio-temporal dynamics of Rab5 domains on the membrane of early endosomes\nPEOPLE\nLutz Brusch\nPROJECTS\nEarly Metabolic Injury (LiSyM-EMI - Pillar I)\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nAgent-based model of response of E.coli to different levels of oxygen supply (with FNR and ArcBA)(id: 105 | type: models)\n\nDescription: The model presents the response of E.coli to different levels of oxygen supply, in which the oxidases, Cyo and Cyd, and their regulators, FNR and ArcBA systems, are included.

Within the SulfoSYS-project, focus lies on studying the effect of temperature variation on the central carbohydrate metabolism (CCM) of S. solfataricus that is characterized by the branched Entner–Doudoroff (ED)-like pathway for sugar (glucose, galactose) degradation and the Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas (EMP)-like pathway, which is employed during gluconeogenesis. The effect of temperature changes on the CCM network of S. solfataricus is analyzed by the tight integration of bioinformatics, genome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, and enzymatic data, with all –omic and biochemical data being produced from identical batches of biomass. Beside providing experimental data, one main part of this highly integrative project is the in silico analysis of the CCM network, including the design of a sufficiently precise model according to the silicon cell type model . This model will allow for the computation of the S. solfataricus CCM, and in particular to investigate its robustness to changes in temperature at the system level.\n\n\nASSAYS\nComparison of transcriptome of S. solfataricus at 70 and 80C\nComparison of proteome of S. solfataricus at 70 and 80C\nFermentation of S. solfataricus at 70 and 80C in a batch fermenter\nEnzyme activity tests for S. solfataricus\nIntracellular metabolomics of S. solfataricus at 70 and 80C\nPEOPLE\nPawel Sierocinski\nPROJECTS\nSulfoSys\nPUBLICATIONS\n\"Hot standards\" for the thermoacidophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus\nSOPS\nSulfosys - SOP proteomics\nSulfosys - SOP metabolomics\nSulfosys - SOP microarray\nSulfosys - SOP fermentation\nSTUDIES\nPilot experiment - S. solfataricus grown at 70 and 80 C.\nSUBMITTER\nPawel Sierocinski\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nZucAt: FBA solution of the model under light growth conditions (I)(id: 1334 | type: data_files)\n\nDescription: The solution of Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) represents metabolic flux distribution in ZucAt model under light growth conditions.

FBCS, FIMA, CEng, C.Math, CITP.\r\nI have been involved in the use of computational techniques for modelling biological systems since 1980. More recently I have developed a technique of agent-based modelling based on the framework FLAME which is the only such system that can be run on supercomputers. We have made significant new biological discoveries using this approach: The approach models the location and activity of millions of individual components such as molecules, receptors; cells in tissue, individual insects in ecologies. We are able to represent intricate biological behaviour and the emergence of structure and function in realistic ways.\r\n1. our model of the NFkappaB system (part of the innate immune system) is probably the most detailed model of this pathway and has led to the prediction of the actinisation of IkappaBalpha - this has been confirmed experimentally\r\n2. models of epithelial tissue have been built and the role of stem cells in wound healing has been predicted and confirmed experimentally\r\n3. models of foraging strategies of ant communities - Monomorium pharoensis - has uncovered the geometric structure of pheromone trails and why this is\r\n4 .In SUMO we are modelling the oxygen system in E. coli by representing every relevant molecule and its location within a single cell and studying the interplay between the transcription factors and genes and how these interact within a complex control system. All of the parameters are besed on experimental data from the SUMO consortium. We have predicted the possible existence of a new transcription factor and its properties - other than Fnr and ArcA - and this is being investigated experimentally.\r\n\n\n\nINSTITUTIONS\nUniversity of Sheffield\nPROJECTS\nSUMO\nPUBLICATIONS\nModelling complex biological systems using an agent-based approach\nTowards a Systems Level Understanding of the Oxygen Response of Escherichia coli\nAgent-based modeling of oxygen-responsive transcription factors in Escherichia coli\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nGene expression levels in mutants with linear respiratory chain(id: 1129 | type: data_files)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nASSAYS\nGene expression analysis of mutants with linear electron transport chain at different aerobiosis levels\nCREATORS\nKatja Bettenbrock\nINVESTIGATIONS\nAnalysis of Escherichia coli with linear electron transport chain\nPEOPLE\nKatja Bettenbrock\nPROJECTS\nSUMO\nSTUDIES\nAnalysis of Escherichia coli strains with linear respiratory chain\nSUBMITTER\nKatja Bettenbrock\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCellPublisher: a web platform for the intuitive visualization and sharing of metabolic, signalling and regulatory pathways(id: 156 | type: publications)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nPEOPLE\nJoerg Stuelke\nLeif Steil\nLope A.

Since 2008 I am now Professor of Systems Biology at the University of Luxembourg.\r\n\r\nThe research of the Systems Biology Group at the University of Luxembourg is focussed in the area of experimental and theoretical systems biology. We are applying different modelling techniques (mainly ODE and logical) to biological systems to develop suitable computational models. The analysis of these models using system theoretical methods helps gaining insight into dynamic and stationary properties of the investigated biological networks which in turn is the basis for the suggestion of further promising experiments. We are also performing experimental validation of the models using cell cultivation facilities.\r\n\r\nWithin the area of mammalian signal transduction one main focus lays in the development of mathematical models of pro- and anti-apoptotic signalling by death receptors in mammalian cells. We are interested in understanding and influencing the signalling protein networks that govern the decision between life and programmed cell death. The second main focus is on the inflammatory signalling networks which play a crucial role within many aging-related diseases like cancer, Alzheimer’s and atherosclerosis.\r\n\r\nIn addition experimental validation using mammalian cell cultivation is performed within our own cell cultivation facility in close collaboration with experimental groups within the Life Sciences Research Unit. \n\n\nINSTITUTIONS\nUniversity of Stuttgart\nPROJECTS\nSUMO\nPUBLICATIONS\nBasic Regulatory Principles of Escherichia coli's Electron Transport Chain for Varying Oxygen Conditions\nA mathematical model of metabolism and regulation provides a systems-level view of how Escherichia coli responds to oxygen\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nMathematical Modelling of the pH-induced Metabolic Shift in C. aceobutylicum Unravels a Heterogeneous Phase Transition(id: 73 | type: presentations)\n\nDescription: The acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation of Clostridium acetobutylicum attracts new attention because it provides a potential alternative for the synthesis of value added chemicals to petroleum and other fossil reserves. This fermentative metabolic process comprises two distinct metabolic states that differ in their product spectrum. Growing on starch or sugars the predominant fermentation products are acetate and butyrate during acidogenesis (high pH). In contrast, C. acetobutylicum produces the solvents acetone and butanol during solventogenesis (low pH). In a continuous culture under phosphate limitation, the shift between both metabolic states can be induced by changes of the external pH level. Existing models were unable to reproduce the dynamics of this phase transition.\r\nHere, we present a kinetic model of ABE fermentation in continuous culture that incorporates metabolic reactions, changes of the proteomic composition, pH-dependent kinetics, and population growth. Our analyses of three independent shift experiments led us to the hypothesis that the pH-induced metabolic shift is a heterogeneous process governed by two sub-populations. The extension of our kinetic model with respect to this hypothesis better reproduces the experimental data and led us to the conclusion that an acidogenic and a solventogenic phenotype coexist during the transition from acidogenesis and solventogenesis and vice versa. Furthermore, we show that the measured evolution of the optical density (OD600) represents a transition between these two phenotypes.\r\nFurther analysis revealed that the metabolic shift is governed by three different time scales under the experimental conditions. The rapid decline of the external pH level affects the kinetic properties of the ABE fermentation. Interestingly, the acidogenic population seems to be able to respond to these environmental changes until the pH drops below a critical value. Then, the fermentation pathway is seriously disturbed, so that the acidogenic cells are incapable to grow further. Simultaneously, a low level solventogenic population is increasing. The rise of the solventogenic phenotype starts around 20 hours after the pH-shift and is completed after approximate 50 hours.\r\nThe origin of the solventogenic cells is still unsettled. We suggest two potential explanations: First, the clostridial population is heterogeneous during both metabolic states. Second, few acidogenic cells, selected by unknown criteria, are able to shift their phenotype.

This work has been completed with 11 bio-reps and found significant metabolic changes as you can see in the IDEOM file attached. 'Comparison' tab in the data spread sheet shows heat maps and fold change analysis regarding different metabolite levels (T: T brucei, TMB: T. brucei exposed to methylene blue, numbers: time points, 0, 5, 60 & 120min). If you double click any metabolite name (column E), then you will be able to see the graph showing the metabolite level. If you want to understand more about IDEOM, please see the below reference as IDEOM has been recently published in Bioinformatics. Through multivariate and univariate analysis,  a potential oxidative stress maker has been found since the level of ariginine phosphate dramatically decreased as methylene blue concentration increased. The participation of the phosphagen system related to arginine kinase in oxidative stress responses has been already reported (C. A. Pereira et al., 2003, FEBS Letters, 554, 201-205). Arginine kinase kock-out (ArgK KO) cells have been already produced and it is under investigation if there are any different drug responses between ArgK KO and wild type cells.\r\n\r\nFor IDEOM: D.

Minor errors in the published Supplementary Information are described in a file attached to version 1 of this model (the published SBML is correct).\t&nbsp;The model describes the circuit depicted in Fig. 1 of the paper (GIF attached). It updates the Pokhilko et al. 2010 model (termed P2010), <a href=\"http://www.plasmo.ed.ac.uk/plasmo/models/model.shtml?accession=PLM_6\">PLM_6</a>, by including:<ol><li>\t\tthe Evening Complex genes (ELF4, ELF3, LUX),</li><li>\t\tlight-regulated degradation of ELF3 by COP1,</li><li>\t\tTOC1 as a repressor rather than an activator of LHY/CCA1.</li></ol>\tThese changes allowed the removal of hypothetical components TOC1mod (or X) and Y from the earlier models. They also reveal that the central loop of the model is a triple-repressor ring oscillator, or 'repressilator' (illustrated in Fig. 8, GIF attached).\tSBML curation notes (please see Comments for each version): Compared to the model version submitted to the Biomodels database, version 1 here slightly alters the names of some variables and uses an SBML AssignmentRule for the light input. A MATLAB version is attached to version 1. In version 2, the rule is used with a generic SBML StepFunction (Adams et al. J. Biol. Rhythms Aug 2012) to describe the light-dark cycle more flexibly. Versions 1 and 2 have multiple sinks and sources created by CellDesigner. These are removed in versions 3 &amp; 4. Version 3 has the published lightfunction, and an equivalent COPASI file attached. Version 4 has the StepFunction.<br><br><strong>Related Publications</strong></strong><br>Alexandra Pokhilko, Aurora Piñas Fernández, Kieron D Edwards, Megan M Southern, Karen J Halliday & Andrew J Millar (2012).

Modeling will be used to predict enzyme levels based on the integration of an RNA degradation model with translation and protein degradation rates. \r\n\r\nPlan: The amounts of a protein in a cell can be determined by the rates of transcription, mRNA processing, translation, mRNA turnover and protein degradation. In trypanosomes analysis is simpler because the transcription rates of individual genes are (with few exceptions) not subject to control (Clayton and Shapira, 2007). This investigation will involve two main studies:\r\n\r\n1. Determination of the abundance, processing efficiency, and degradation kinetics of the mRNAs encoding all enzymes of interest. For this goal RNA will be extracted at several times points of trypanosomes treated with Actinomycin D and Sinefungin, to inhibit RNAprocessing and transcription, and sequenced with Next Generation Sequencing (RNAseq).\r\n\r\n2. Determination of the rate of translation. This will be based on ribosomal loading: we will fractionate extracts on sucrose gradients and perform RNASeq across the polysome profile.

The scale for pS6 (E) was estimated in arbitrary units. GTP-Ras (F) and ppERK were determined upon stimulation with indicated, color-coded Epo doses. pEpoR was analyzed by immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting, GTP-Ras was analyzed after pulldown using a fusion protein harboring GST fused to the Ras binding domain of Raf-1 followed by detection by quantitative immunoblotting. For pAkt and ppERK, cellular lysates were subjected to quantitative immunoblotting.

In this model, the phloem was considered as a non-growing transport compartment, the mesophyll compartment was considered as both autotrophic (growing on CO2 under light) and heterotrophic (growing on starch in darkness), and the root was always considered as heterotrophic tissue completely dependent on sucrose supply from the mesophyll compartment. In total, the model includes 380 balanced compounds interconnected by 372 transformers. The structured metabolic model accounts for central carbon metabolism, photosynthesis, photorespiration, carbohydrate metabolism, energy and redox metabolisms, proton metabolism, biomass growth, nutrients uptake, proton gradient generation and sucrose translocation between tissues. Biochemical processes in the model were associated with gene-products (742 ORFs) which were validated using mass-spectrometry based proteomic data. Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) of the model resulted in balanced carbon, proton, energy and redox states under both light and dark conditions. Based on the FBA, the model predictes that in light conditions the plastid produced enough ATP to serve the Calvin-Benson cycle and starch formation, and the excess of photosynthetic potential (in form of reducing equivalents) was exported to the mitochondria via malate/oxaloacetate shuttle for ATP synthesis. The main H+-fluxes were reconstructed and sucrose translocation matched with them. \n\n\nASSAYS\nFlux Balance Analysis of multi-compartment metabolic model of growing Arabidopsis thaliana\nCREATORS\nMaksim Zakhartsev\nOlga Krebs\nDATA_FILES\nZucAt: FBA constraints for light conditions\nZucAt: FBA constraints for dark conditions\nZucAt: FBA solution of the model under dark growth conditions\nZucAt: The stoichiometric matrix of the model\nZucAt: The compound database\nZucAt: The gene database\nZucAt: The transformers database\nZucAt: FBA solution of the model under light growth conditions (I)\nZucAt: FBA solution of the model under light growth conditions (II)\nZucAt: FBA solution of the model under light growth conditions (III)\nZucAt: the model documentation\nZucAt: FBA solution of the model under light growth conditions (IV)\nZucAt: FBA solution of the model under light growth conditions (V)\nINVESTIGATION\nMetabolic analysis of effects of sucrose translocation on phenotypic traits of Arabidopsis thaliana\nMODELS\nZucAt: multi-compartment metabolic model of growing Arabidopsis thaliana\nPEOPLE\nMaksim Zakhartsev\nOlga Krebs\nPROJECTS\nZucAt\nSUBMITTER\nMaksim Zakhartsev\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nPreparation of cell extracts of recombinant E.coli(id: 188 | type: sops)\n\nDescription: Preparation of cell free extracts of the recombinant E. coli strains expressing the gluconeogenic S. solfataricus enzymes.\n\n\nASSAYS\nPGK\nGAPDH\nTPI\nFBPAase\nCREATORS\nJacky Snoep\nTheresa Kouril\nINVESTIGATIONS\nCentral Carbon Metabolism of Sulfolobus solfataricus\nPEOPLE\nJacky Snoep\nTheresa Kouril\nPROJECTS\nSulfoSys\nSTUDIES\nModel Gluconeogenesis\nSUBMITTER\nJacky Snoep\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nSOP - Bioleaching in flasks (LNU)(id: 239 | type: sops)\n\nDescription: Initial configuration and parameters of the Bioleaching\n\n\nASSAYS\nExperimental methods\nCREATORS\nStephan Christel\nINVESTIGATIONS\nMulti -omics reveal lifestyle of acidophile, mineral-oxidizing model species Leptospirillum ferriphilumT\nPEOPLE\nStephan Christel\nPROJECTS\nSysMetEx\nSTUDIES\nOmics_data_analysis\nSUBMITTER\nStephan Christel\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nSOP for cultivation of B.Subtilis(id: 83 | type: sops)\n\nDescription: SOP for shake flask cultivation of B.Subtilis in Bacell-Sysmo \n\n\nASSAYS\nIPTG induction of sigmaB in BSA115\nTiling Array analysis of glucose strarved B. subtilis cells\nCREATORS\nPraveen Kumar Sappa\nINVESTIGATIONS\nThe transition from growing to non-growing Bacillus subtilis cells\nRedefining the Complete Transcriptome of Bacillus subtilis using Tiling Array Technology.\nPEOPLE\nPraveen Kumar Sappa\nPROJECTS\nBaCell-SysMO\nSTUDIES\nControlled sigmaB induction in shake flask\nTranscriptome analysis of glucose starvation in B. subtilis\nSUBMITTER\nPraveen Kumar Sappa\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nMalate-mediated carbon catabolite repression in Bacillus subtilis involves the HPrK/CcpA pathway(id: 186 | type: publications)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nDATA_FILES\nProtein report on identification of interaction partners of CitG in a SPINE experiment\nCatabolite repression of β-xylosidase by different carbon sources in various mutants\nPEOPLE\nJoerg Stuelke\nLeif Steil\nPROJECTS\nBaCell-SysMO\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nEnzyme activity Gst+Cat_Kollevåg(id: 2255 | type: data_files)\n\nDescription: Measurement of Gst and Cat enzyme activity in liver of fish caged in Kollevåg.\n\n\nASSAYS\nEnzyme activity assays\nCREATORS\nKarina Dale\nPEOPLE\nKarina Dale\nPROJECTS\nSystems toxicology of Atlantic cod\nSTUDIES\nCaging study - Kollevåg\nSUBMITTER\nKarina Dale\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nATP levels under 10 mM benzoic acid stress(id: 49 | type: studies)\n\nDescription: To see changes in ATP levels in cells with induced ABC transporters.

The production host of choice is the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli for which many strains and expression systems have been developed. However, one size does not fit all: E. coli is not suitable for the production of many proteins, either because it is not able to carry out appropriate post-translational modifications (e.g. glycosylation) or because it does not facilitate their folding into a native (i.e. functional) configuration. The former can be overcome by use of more expensive eukaryotic host production systems, while the latter can often be overcome by secreting proteins from the cytoplasm. Secretion has three major potential advantages over intracellular accumulation: the secreted target protein is usually natively folded; yields can be as high or higher than that obtained from intracellular E. coli host/vector systems; there is a reduced requirement for expensive extraction and purification procedures, with reduced risks of contamination with host proteins and nucleic acids.\r\n\r\nAlthough various microbial protein secretion systems have been developed, all currently have limitations that restrict their use and value as a tool for the Biomanufacturing industry. These systems include secretion into the periplasm of E. coli and subsequent selective release and purification; production in the yeast Pichia pastoris; production in Bacillus subtilis and close relatives. In all cases, the yields are relatively low compared with that of the intracellular E. coli systems (mg rather than g per litre).\r\n\r\nBacillus subtilis is widely used for the commercial production of industrial enzymes, particularly for the food and detergents’ industries. Its advantage is its capacity to secrete native Bacillus proteins into the culture medium at concentrations in excess of ten of grams per litre. However, experience with the use of this bacterium for the production of heterologous proteins has been mixed with, in most cases, generally low yields. The aim of this proposal is to exploit knowledge of the genomics and systems biology of B. subtilis to develop this bacterium as a host/vector system for the production of high quality heterologous proteins for clinical trials and for high-throughput X-ray crystallographic studies. The aim is not to replace E. coli as the primary host for heterologous protein production, but to expand the range of host/vector systems that are available for problematical proteins.\r\n\r\nResponse of Bacillus anthracis to stress in the environment and in host cells Infectious disease is the culmination of a battle between the pathogen and its host. Central to the host’s innate defence mechanism are phagocytic cells; macrophages and dendritic cells. Phagocytes express a series of antibacterial factors, including reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, antibacterial peptides and enzymes. They can also impose increased acidification. In spite of these defence mechanisms, several clinically important pathogens can proliferate inside macrophages. The interaction between B. anthracis and host macrophages is central to its pathogenesis. However, an understanding of the cellular and molecular interactions between B. anthracis and the immune system is far from complete. B. anthracis avoids and even breaches cells of the immune system: vegetative cells avoid macrophages by virtue of their possession of a poly-D-glutamic acid capsule, while engulfment of spores by alveolar macrophages and their subsequent efficient germination within the macrophage is an important component of its ability to cause infection. However, it is not clear if B. anthracis can multiply in macrophages. We are dissecting the B. anthracis-macrophage relationship through a combined cellular, genetic and molecular approach.\n\n\nDATA_FILES\nThe condition-dependent transcriptome of Bacillus subtilis 168\nINSTITUTIONS\nUniversity of Newcastle\nPRESENTATIONS\nBiophysical analysis of putative interactions between TCA cycle enzymes of B. subtilis\nPROJECTS\nBaCell-SysMO\nPUBLICATIONS\nCondition-dependent transcriptome reveals high-level regulatory architecture in Bacillus subtilis\nEnvironmental salinity determines the specificity and need for Tat-dependent secretion of the YwbN protein in Bacillus subtilis\nDissection of the network of interactions that links RNA processing with glycolysis in the Bacillus subtilis degradosome\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nArabidopsis clock model P2011.6.1 - PLM_1044, version 1, SIMPLIFIED(id: 387 | type: models)\n\nDescription: Simplified model file for PLaSMo accession ID PLM_1044, version 1 (use simplified if your software cannot read the file, e.g. Sloppy Cell)\n\n\nASSAYS\nArabidopsis clock model P2011.6.1 - PLM_1044, version 1\nCREATORS\nBioData SynthSys\nAndrew Millar\nINVESTIGATIONS\nMillar, Andrew\nPEOPLE\nAndrew Millar\nBioData SynthSys\nPROJECTS\nPlaSMo model repository\nSTUDIES\nArabidopsis clock model P2011.6.1 - PLM_1044\nSUBMITTER\nBioData SynthSys\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nProtocol for glyoxalase II extracts and kinetic assays.(id: 32 | type: sops)\n\nDescription: Method of how to perform the purification of glyoxalase II as well as kinetics assays.\n\n\nCREATORS\nLisbeth Lyngberg\nPEOPLE\nLisbeth Lyngberg\nPROJECTS\nKOSMOBAC\nSUBMITTER\nLisbeth Lyngberg\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nPoster presentation Netherlands Biotechnology Congress(id: 36 | type: presentations)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nCREATORS\nJohn Raedts\nServé Kengen\nPEOPLE\nServé Kengen\nJohn Raedts\nPROJECTS\nCOSMIC\nSUBMITTER\nJohn Raedts\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nGrowth, yield and cAMP excretion under anaerobic conditions(id: 1070 | type: data_files)\n\nDescription: Measurement of by-product formation rates, substrate consumption rates and extracellular concentrations of cAMP under anaerobic batch conditions with glucose as substrate.\n\n\nASSAYS\nAerobic and anaerobic characterization of MG1655 and mutant strains with regard to growth, by-product formation and cAMP concentrations.\nCREATORS\nSonja Steinsiek\nINVESTIGATIONS\nAnalysis of the glucose transport in Escherichia coli under aerobic and anaerobic conditions\nPEOPLE\nSonja Steinsiek\nPROJECTS\nSUMO\nPUBLICATIONS\nGlucose Transport in Escherichia coli Mutant Strains with Defects in Sugar Transport Systems\nSTUDIES\nCharacterization of mutant strains with defects in sugar transport systems\nSUBMITTER\nSonja Steinsiek\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCarbon Core deFBA Model(id: 557 | type: models)\n\nDescription: A small model representing the core carbon network in each cell.

This is mainly established by the accuracy of the active centre of RNA polymerase (RNAP). Based on in vitro experiments with Escherichia coli RNAP it was also suggested that proofreading of transcription via RNA hydrolysis by RNAP may contribute to overall fidelity and processivity. RNAP’s intrinsic cleavage activity is stimulated by the highly conserved Gre factors suggesting that Gre factors in this way further contribute to transcription fidelity. The in vivo role of Gre however, remains poorly understood. Furthermore, limited functional studies have been performed in bacteria outside E. coli. Here we examine the role of the Gre factor of the Gram-positive human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, GreA. We show that GreA is not essential in S. pneumoniae although ΔgreA cells show a slower growth rate and morphological defects. To examine if transcription fidelity is affected by greA deletion in vivo, we constructed a plasmid that contains a constitutively expressed lacZ gene containing a stop codon mutation. Functional LacZ will thus be only produced if errors in transcription or translation are regularly made. Using this in vivo fidelity system we show that cells mutated for greA show significant levels of β-galactosidase activity, indicating that GreA promotes transcription fidelity in vivo. To explore the mechanism of GreA-dependent transcription fidelity in more detail, we have purified S. pneumoniae GreA and S. pneumoniae RNAP and performed in vitro transcription assays. We show that S. pneumoniae GreA indeed improves transcription fidelity in vitro. Interestingly, S. pneumoniae RNAP seems to be less processive than other bacterial RNAPs, forming strong species-specific pauses. S. pneumoniae GreA helps in overcoming these pauses and thereby improves RNAP’s processivity, thus increasing RNAP’s overall elongation rate. Genetic switches that depend on critical thresholds in concentration of regulator protein should be especially responsive to changes in transcription fidelity and rate. In line with this idea, the greA mutant was unable to become naturally competent for DNA uptake, a developmental process that is under the control of a sensitive genetic switch. Our results therefore suggest that fidelity/processivity of transcription facilitated by GreA is crucial for cell well being, and may play an important role in the control of genetic switches. \n\n\nASSAYS\nRNA-Seq\nDATA_FILES\nRNA-seq wild type\nRNA-seq delta greA\nINVESTIGATION\nWetlab approach to transcription fidelity\nPEOPLE\nJan-Willem Veening\nPROJECTS\nNoisy-Strep\nPUBLICATIONS\nControl of transcription elongation by GreA determines rate of gene expression in Streptococcus pneumoniae\nSUBMITTER\nJan-Willem Veening\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nContributions of the pre- and pro-regions of a Staphylococcus hyicus lipase to secretion of a heterologous protein by Bacillus subtilis(id: 77 | type: publications)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nPEOPLE\nUwe Voelker\nJan Maarten Van Dijl\nPROJECTS\nBaCell-SysMO\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nGeneration of RNAi cell lines in T.brucei brucei 2T1 cell line(id: 153 | type: sops)\n\nDescription: We routinely select specific RNAi gene targets (400–600 bp) and primers using the RNAit software http://trypanofan.path.cam.ac.uk/software/RNAit.html.

The antisense and sense fragments are generated by BamHI–KpnI and XbaI–ApaI digestion respectively.\r\nSelectable marker (HYG) transcription is then constitutive (PEP: procyclin promoter) and independent of the Tet-regulated cassette (PRRNA: RRNA promoter).\r\nWe maintain 2T1 T. brucei cells (Lister 427, MITat1.2, clone 221a), that also express the Tn10 Tet repressor (TetR::BLE::TUB), in HMI-11 growth medium containing phleomycin and puromycin (0.5 µg ml−1 and 0.2 µg ml−1 respectively). We use electroporation (Amaxa) with ∼2.5 × 107 cells and ∼3 µg of each AscI-linearised construct in duplicate; each mixture is transferred to 36 ml of medium in a 25 cm2 culture flask. After ∼6 h, the appropriate drug selection is applied (2.5 µg ml−1 hygromycin) and cells are distributed into 12- or 24-well plates. Each electroporation experiment typically, and conveniently, yields 2–5 transformed clones using this approach and these are visible after ∼5 days (∼100,000 cells). To screen clones for simple, double-crossover integration and loss of the PAC gene, we remove ∼5% of each day-5, hygR culture and grow with or without puromycin (2 µg ml−1 ) in a 24-well plate for another 24–48 h. Typically, ∼50% of clones are puromycin sensitive and two of these are retained for further analysis. Note that these strains are now resistant to phleomycin (TetR::BLE::TUB) and hygromycin (HYG::RPa::RRNA). \n\n\nASSAYS\nGeneration of RNAi cell lines in T.brucei brucei 2T1 cell line\nCREATORS\nFederico Rojas\nINVESTIGATIONS\nPerturbing the biological system: developmental adaptation and experimental manipulation of trypanosome biology\nPEOPLE\nFederico Rojas\nPROJECTS\nSilicoTryp\nSTUDIES\nTargeted disruption and over expression of critical enzymes\nSUBMITTER\nFederico Rojas\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nSulfosys - SOP proteomics(id: 64 | type: sops)\n\nDescription: Standard operating procedures regarding iTraq based proteomics.\n\n\nASSAYS\nComparison of proteome of S. solfataricus at 70 and 80C\nCREATORS\nPawel Sierocinski\nINVESTIGATIONS\nAnalysis of Central Carbon Metabolism of Sulfolobus solfataricus under varying temperature\nPEOPLE\nPawel Sierocinski\nPROJECTS\nSulfoSys\nSTUDIES\nPilot experiment - S. solfataricus grown at 70 and 80 C.\nSUBMITTER\nPawel Sierocinski\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nSABIO-RK documentation web services(id: 1392 | type: data_files)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nCREATORS\nUlrike Wittig\nPEOPLE\nUlrike Wittig\nPROJECTS\nKinetics on the move - Workshop 2016\nSUBMITTER\nUlrike Wittig\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nGene Knock-out Through Allelic Exchange(id: 168 | type: sops)\n\nDescription: A protocol to improve conventional, recombination-based gene knock-out methodologies thtough the provision of negative selection markers, pyrE or codA.\n\n\nCREATORS\nYing Zhang\nNigel Minton\nPEOPLE\nNigel Minton\nYing Zhang\nPROJECTS\nCOSMIC\nSUBMITTER\nYing Zhang\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nTrigger enzymes: bifunctional proteins active in metabolism and in controlling gene expression(id: 151 | type: publications)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nPEOPLE\nJoerg Stuelke\nLeif Steil\nPROJECTS\nBaCell-SysMO\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nMolecular diffusion in E. coli(id: 29 | type: sops)\n\nDescription: Pulsed-FRAP  measure the diffusion constants in confined volumes in small cells like E. coli and other bacteria or cellular organelles. \n\n\nCREATORS\nLisbeth Lyngberg\nPEOPLE\nLisbeth Lyngberg\nPROJECTS\nKOSMOBAC\nSUBMITTER\nLisbeth Lyngberg\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nAnalysis of the genome-wide distribution of RNA polymerase upon methylglyoxal stress in Escherichia coli using ChIP-chip(id: 36 | type: sops)\n\nDescription: A procedure to analyse the genomic interaction of E.coli RNA polymerase (RNAP) upon methylglyoxal (MG) stress, a toxic keto-aldehyde by-product of metabolism.\n\n\nCREATORS\nLisbeth Lyngberg\nPEOPLE\nLisbeth Lyngberg\nPROJECTS\nKOSMOBAC\nSUBMITTER\nLisbeth Lyngberg\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nInsights into Streptococcus pyogenes pathogenesis from transcriptome studies(id: 101 | type: publications)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nPEOPLE\nBernd Kreikemeyer\nTomas Fiedler\nPROJECTS\nSysMO-LAB\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nTowards the development of Bacillus subtilis as a cell factory for membrane proteins and protein complexes(id: 64 | type: publications)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nPEOPLE\nMichael Hecker\nUwe Voelker\nJan Maarten Van Dijl\nPROJECTS\nBaCell-SysMO\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nThomas Hentrich(id: 538 | type: people)\n\nDescription: Trained as a Computer Scientist at the University of Jena, Germany, my interests drifted more and more towards \"computing life\" during my PhD at Simon Fraser University and the University of British Columbia, Canada. On one hand, that term captures that I got fascinated by the idea to understand life as a form of computation and to describe, reprogram, and reassemble parts of cells as described in many brilliant experiments from a spectrum of disciplines ranging from DNA computing to Synthetic biology. On the other hand \"computing life\" stands for the fact that I really like to use empirical data to derive and describe the principles that govern and exhibit cellular functions of living systems. That's the range of (bio-)informatics of my work.\r\nIn particular, I am focusing on epigenetic mechanisms and the epigenome as a cellular computation/regulation layer, which is capable of integrating (external) signals into a genetic regulatory program and which exhibits great plasticity to adjust cell functions in health and disease states. Since my PostDoc time at the University of Tübingen, Germany, I am eager to explore the role of epigenetics in the realm of complex neurological disorders, which seem to be heavily influenced by environmental factors regarding onset and progression of the disease. In a systems-approach, I am employing bioinformatics to identify molecular parts of that system that fail and trigger the disease, and potentially identify therapeutic targets that can be exploited to fix that \"erroneous\" computation and restore a healthy system state.\n\n\nINSTITUTIONS\nUniversity of Tübingen\nPROJECTS\nICYSB 2015 - International Practical Course in Systems Biology\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nLiver transcriptome analysis of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) exposed to PCB 153 indicates effects on cell cycle regulation and lipid metabolism(id: 309 | type: publications)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nPEOPLE\nFekadu Yadetie\nPROJECTS\nSystems toxicology of Atlantic cod\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCcpA forms complexes with CodY and RpoA in Bacillus subtilis(id: 160 | type: publications)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nPEOPLE\nUwe Voelker\nPraveen Kumar Sappa\nGerald Seidel\nMaike  Bartholomae\nWolfgang Hillen\nPROJECTS\nBaCell-SysMO\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nSustained glycolytic oscillations in individual isolated yeast cells(id: 379 | type: publications)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nPEOPLE\nJacky Snoep\nDawie Van Niekerk\nPROJECTS\nYeast glycolytic oscillations\nSTUDIES\nSustained glycolytic oscillations in individual isolated yeast cells\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCompare ATP extraction methods(id: 102 | type: assays)\n\nDescription: We will compare two different procedures to extract ATP from yeast cells: Standard kit procedure (hot Tris/EDTA) and Serrano procedure (cold perchloric acid).

The central principle of this proposal is that important aspects of the functional differences between organisms derive not only from the differences in genetic components (which underlies comparative genomics) but also from the interactions between their components (see Fig. 1). Therefore, this project will develop Comparative Systems Biology (CSB).\r\nModel system: The project focuses on three relatively simple and highly related microorganisms, which nevertheless exhibit stark and important differences in their functional relationship with human beings: These organisms are homofermentative lactic acid bacteria, namely Lactococcus lactis, the major microorganism used in the dairy industry, Enterococcus faecalis, a major (fecal) contaminant in food and water as well as a \r\ncontributor to food fermentation, and Streptococcus pyogenes, an important human pathogen. These organisms have similar primary metabolism, but persist in completely different environments (milk, faeces, blood). Lactococcus lactis will be used as the reference microorganism, since: (i) it is by far the best studied lactic acid bacterium, (ii) three different genomes have been sequenced, (iii) a kinetic model has been developed for its complete glycolysis including some branching pathways, (iv) genetic and metabolic engineering tools are available and (v) a functional genomics platform has been set-up including DNA microarray and metabolic databases.\r\nDeliverables: The specific deliverables of this project will be \r\n(i) a thorough understanding of the differences and similarities in systems biology (components and how these components interact) between these three organisms and the extent to which these differences contribute to the organisms being different functionally (Fig. 1).\r\n(ii) generic methods and tools for transfer of systems biology knowledge from one organism to another by comparative analysis. \r\nThis multidisciplinary approach will result in mathematical, comprehensive, models that quantitatively describe the catabolic (product formation) response of lactic acid bacteria under different, industrially relevant, conditions. These models will help in the design of strategies that optimise functional activities such as acidification and flavour production, but also strategies to control or reduce growth of undesirable contaminants and pathogens. \r\nMethodology: The project will focus on carbon metabolism and its response to aeration, change of sugar-source, addition of heme and elimination of the crucial metabolic enzyme, lactate dehydrogenase. Cells will be grown in a non-nutrient-limited turbidostat that will allow maximal growth under defined conditions. The major regulatory events at the genetic level (adaptive mutations), the transcription, translation, enzymatic and metabolic level up to the final output (functional) level, will be quantified and then integrated in iterations between experimentation (all~omics) and modeling (network structure, flux balances, dynamics, control, regulation). The detailed knowledge from the reference strain L lactis will be used to accelerate the model development of the other two, less-well studied, organisms (contributing to deliverable ii in that process).\r\n\n\n\nASSAYS\nGlucose pulsed S. pyogenes\nBIOLOG substrate utilization assay\nGlucose pulsed L. lactis\nKinetics of L-lactate dehydrogenase from S. pyogenes, E. faecalis, and L. plantarum\nKinetics of L-lactate dehydrogenase from L. lactis\nGlobal sensitivity analysis\nModel of L. lactis glycolysis\nMaximal specific growth rates of the three lactic acid bacteria and their ldh deletions\nPhysiological characterization of Lactic acid bacteria grown in C-limited continuous cultures\nGenome-scale model of Streptococcus pyogenes\nGenome-Scale Model Enterococcus faecalis V583\nRegulation of the activity of lactate dehydrogenases from four lactic acid bacteria\nDATA_FILES\nGlucose pulsed S pyogenes\nGlucose pulsed L. lactis\nGlucose pulsed L. lactis 2\nMaximal specific growth rates of the three lactic acid bacteria and their ldh deletions.\nCharacterization of flux distribution and general physiology of S. pyogenes in continuous cultures\nCharacterization of flux distribution and general physiology of E. faecalis in continuous cultures\nCharacterization of flux distribution and general physiology of L. lactis in continuous cultures\nKinetic behavior of intracellular metabolites of L. lactis upon a glucose-pulse\nComparison of maximal build-up of metabolites in lactococcus lactis upon a 20 mM glucose-pulse\nMeasurements on kinetics of L-LDHs from different latic acid bacteria at pH 6.0 and pH 7.0.\nThe effects of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, phosphate and ionic strength on enzyme activity differ for the three LDHs from three Lactic acid bacterias.\n3D-sturctures of Lactate Dehydrogenase from 4 Lactic Acid Bacteria predicted by Comparative Modeling Tool\nElectrostatic potentials of four LDH enzymes from LAB\nComparison of electrostatic potentials of LDH enzymes from fours LABs.\nExample for the binding energy computation of phosphate ion on the surface of LDH from Lactococcus lactis type 1\nActivation / Inhibition of 4 LDH enzymes in the presence of phosphate ions (Pi).\nMODELS\nGenome-scale model of Streptococcus pyogenes\nPart 1: Comparative modeling of 3D structures of LDH enzymes\nPart 3: Comparison of electrostatic potentials for FBP binding\nPart 2: Computation of electrostatic potentials for 4 LDH enzymes\nPart 4: Activation / Inhibition Effect on LDHs function in the presence of Phosphate ions\nPart 5: Algorithm to computationally estimate the effect of Pi for 4 LDH enzymes\nGenome-scale metabolic model of Enterococcus faecalis V583\nPEOPLE\nMartijn Bekker\nPROJECTS\nSysMO-LAB\nPUBLICATIONS\nPhysiological characterization of three lactic acid bacteria and their isogenic ldh deletion mutants shows that these organisms are optimized for Yatp and not ATP formation rates at their physiological pH\nRegulation of the Activity of Lactate Dehydrogenases from Four Lactic Acid Bacteria\nSOPS\nAnalysis of organic acid by HPLC\nQuenching of lactic acid bacteria\nProtocol for glucose perturbations\nMeasurement of LDH activity\nSOP 7 Glucose-pulse experiments\nSOP 8 Glucose-pulse experiments (adapted for S. pyogenes)\nSOP 5 Analysis of intracellular metabolites\nSOP 6 Analysis of intracellular metabolites\nSOP 4B  Quenching and extraction of intracellular metabolites\nSOP 2.1 Method for synthesis of LAB-medium used for the SYSMO-LAB project\nSTUDIES\nComparative modeling and phosphate dependence flux distributions and glucose consumption rates of two lactic acid bacteria S. pyogenes and L. lactis\nReconstructing the metabolic pathways of S. pyogenes and E. faecalis from their genome sequence\nStudy of the physiological characterization of three lactic acid bacteria and their isogenic ldh deletion mutants\nKinetics of L-lactate dehydrogenase from S. pyogenes, E. faecalis and L. plantarum\nSUBMITTER\nMartijn Bekker\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nGLCtr Kinetic characterisation(id: 191 | type: sops)\n\nDescription: SOP for measurement of glucose transport activity in intact trophozoites.\n\n\nCREATORS\nDawie Van Niekerk\nJacky Snoep\nPEOPLE\nJacky Snoep\nDawie Van Niekerk\nPROJECTS\nWhole body modelling of glucose metabolism in malaria patients\nSUBMITTER\nDawie Van Niekerk\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nMorgiane Richard(id: 157 | type: people)\n\nDescription: My background is physics engineering & biomedical engineering.

The gene regulation net-work governing sporulation initiation accordingly incorporates a variety of signals and is of significant complexity. The present model (Bulletin of Mathematical Biology (2011) 73:181–211)  includes four of these signals: nutrient levels, DNA damage, the products of the competence genes, and cell population size. An interesting prediction derived from the model is that PhrA, which is secreted from the cell and subsequently re-imported can act simultaneously as a quorum-sensing signal and as a timing mechanism, delaying sporulation when the cell has damaged DNA, possibly thereby allowing the cell time to repair its DNA before forming a spore.\r\n\r\nSimulation link at JWS Online: http://jjj.mib.ac.uk/webMathematica/Examples/run.jsp?modelName=jabbari\n\n\nCREATORS\nSara Jabbari\nJohn Heap\nJohn King\nPEOPLE\nJohn King\nJohn Heap\nSara Jabbari\nFranco Du Preez\nPROJECTS\nSysMO DB\nPUBLICATIONS\nMathematical Modelling of the Sporulation-Initiation Network in Bacillus Subtilis Revealing the Dual Role of the Putative Quorum-Sensing Signal Molecule PhrA\nSUBMITTER\nFranco Du Preez\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nMOA2010-05_2_transcriptomics_qPCR_MIQE(id: 2774 | type: data_files)\n\nDescription: RT-qPCR assays for microarray validation described using the MIQE standard.\n\n\nASSAYS\nTranscriptomics (qPCR)\nINVESTIGATIONS\nMOA - Multiomics analysis of potato response to Potato virus Y (PVY) infection\nPEOPLE\nZiva Ramsak\nPROJECTS\nMOA - Multiomics analysis of potato response to Potato virus Y (PVY) infection\nSTUDIES\nMOA2010-05\nSUBMITTER\nZiva Ramsak\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nLDH Kinetic characterisation(id: 202 | type: sops)\n\nDescription: SOP for measurement of LDH activity in extracts.\n\n\nASSAYS\nLDH\nCREATORS\nDawie Van Niekerk\nJacky Snoep\nINVESTIGATIONS\nGlucose metabolism in Plasmodium falciparum trophozoites\nPEOPLE\nJacky Snoep\nDawie Van Niekerk\nPROJECTS\nWhole body modelling of glucose metabolism in malaria patients\nSTUDIES\nModel construction\nSUBMITTER\nDawie Van Niekerk\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCellular Adjustments of Bacillus subtilis and Other Bacilli to Fluctuating Salinities(id: 170 | type: publications)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nPEOPLE\nLeif Steil\nErhard Bremer\nPROJECTS\nBaCell-SysMO\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nL1 regularization facilitates detection of cell type-specific parameters in dynamical systems(id: 303 | type: publications)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nPEOPLE\nJens Timmer\nBernhard Steiert\nPROJECTS\nSBEpo - Systems Biology of Erythropoietin\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nKatharina Robichon(id: 516 | type: people)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nObject has no relationships\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nATP levels under 30 mM and 50 mM benzoic acid stress(id: 50 | type: studies)\n\nDescription: ATP levels of cells stressed with higher concentrations of benzoic acid (30 mM and 50 mM).\r\n\r\n\n\n\nASSAYS\nATP measurement under 30mM benzoic acid stress\nATP measurement under 50mM benzoic acid stress\nINVESTIGATION\nEffect of Benzoic Acid on ATP Levels\nPEOPLE\nMartin Valachovic\nPROJECTS\nMOSES\nSOPS\nATP determination with ROCHE kit  “ATP Bioluminescence Assay Kit CLS II”\nSUBMITTER\nMartin Valachovic\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nProcessed microarray data from comparison of E. faecalis wt and deltaEF2933 mutant(id: 1010 | type: data_files)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nCREATORS\nMargrete Solheim\nPEOPLE\nMargrete Solheim\nPROJECTS\nSysMO-LAB\nSUBMITTER\nMargrete Solheim\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\npH-BASED ESTIMATION OF YEAST ATPase ACTIVITY(id: 148 | type: sops)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nCREATORS\nLina Patricia Barreto Parra\nPEOPLE\nLina Patricia Barreto Parra\nPROJECTS\nTRANSLUCENT\nSUBMITTER\nLina Patricia Barreto Parra\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe transition from growing to non-growing Bacillus subtilis cells(id: 2 | type: investigations)\n\nDescription: The objective of this project is an integrated understanding the metabolic, proteomic and genetic network that controls the transition from growth to glucose starvation.

Libraries were sequenced at the Norwegian Sequencing Centre (NSC). All libraries were pooled, and the same pool was sequenced on 4 flow cell lanes on a HiSeq 3000 machine (Illumina), generating 100bp single-end reads. \r\nRNA sequencing files (.fastq) were processed in the following manner: (i) All reads from the same individual were merged into one fastq file. (ii) Reads were mapped to the Atlantic salmon genome (GenBank Accession number: GCA_0002333375.4) using STAR (v 2.6.0c) 50. (iii) Read alignments, recorded in BAM format were subsequently used to count uniquely mapped reads per gene using featurecounts (v1.4.4) 51, with the RefSeq gene_ids.

For each identified interaction, miRNAs/phasiRNA ID, the target transcript identifiers, representative gene identifier, full descriptions, and MapMan ontology annotations (GoMapMan; (Ramšak et al., 2014)) are shown. Short names for potato genes were inferred from Arabidopsis thaliana orthologs where applicable, else the StNIB_v1 gene identifier was set (Ramšak et al., 2014). For each sRNA-target interaction, degradome category are given: Category ‘0’ is defined as > 1 raw read at the position, with abundance at a position equal to the maximum on the transcript, and with only one maximum on the transcript. Category ‘1’ is described as > 1 raw read at the position, with abundance at the position equal to the maximum on the transcript, and more than one maximum position on the transcript. Category ‘2’ includes > 1 raw read at the position, and abundance at the position less than the maximum but higher than the median for the transcript. Category ‘3’ comprised the transcripts with > 1 raw read at the position, and abundance at the position equal to or less than the median for the transcript (Addo-Quaye et al., 2009). For each sRNA-target interaction also p-value (the chance is the total number of peaks of the given category divided by the effective transcriptome size, where 'n' is the number of transcripts), T_Start (one-based start position of the alignment within the transcript, T_Stop (one-based stop position of the alignment within the transcript), T_SLice (one-based position of the alignment opposite position 10 of the query, MFE_perfect (Minimum free energy of a perfectly matched site), MFE_site (Minimum free energy of the alignment), MFE_ratio (MFE_site / MFE_perfect) and number of mismatches are given.  Additionally, for each sRNA the log2FC and p-values among different comparisons are given and the log2FC ratios of target transcripts between PVYNTN and mock inoculated Désirée or NahG-Désirée plants; yellow – upregulated, blue – downregulated, – statistically not significant (FDR p > 0.05). NA – not analyzed or not available.

Specification Documents(id: 304 | type: sops)\n\nDescription: Metabolic networks with gene expression are researched under very different banners with different  techniques. For example, there are  the dynamic enzyme-cost Flux Balance Analysis (deFBA) [1], conditional Flux Balance Analysis [2], Metabolism and Expression models (ME models) [3], Resource Balance Analysis [4], etc. At their core, these methods can all understood as Resource Allocation Models (RAM) and while investigating their potential and their results, we encountered the problem of sharing these types of models between workgroups. The usual goto-standard is the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) but even with the latest available packages some resource allocation model parameters cannot be integrated.\r\n\r\nThus, we have developed the 'ram'-standard, which utilizes the <annotation> field available inside the species and reactions element to solve this problem. Naturally, the standard includes a few more conventions for describing RAM. This document contains all these specifications.\r\n\r\nYou can use the latest version of libsbml (version >5.13) [5] and directly use the 'ram' standard without additional software. At the moment we support interfaces from 'ram' to a Python implementation ([6]) and a MATLAB implementation (link). Below you can also find a few examples of models in the 'ram' format.\r\n\r\nIn this first version we focused on the parameters needed for deFBA models, but we hope to support more model types in the near future. If you want to contribute, you can do so via the issue manager of the bitbucket copy of the specifications [7].\r\n\r\n[1] Waldherr, S.; Oyarzún, D.A.; Bockmayr, A.

Further information may be available via links from the authors web site (<a href=\"http://www.amillar.org\">www.amillar.org</a>).\tSimulation notes for SBML version of Model3 from Salazar et al., Cell, 2009.\tThe interlocking-loop circadian clock in this model reaches its entrained limit cycle rather slowly. To ensure that simulations show the stable phase under any light:dark cycle, the model should be run for 720 hours (30 days) before evaluating its behaviour in light:dark cycles. Using the boundary value solver in Matlab, as described in the paper, avoids this issue.\tSBML prepared by Dr. Treenut Saithong, based on Matlab by Dr. Domingo Salazar.

sorting and secretion in Gram-positive bacteria, such as Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus.\r\n\r\nThe Gram-positive bacterium B. subtilis is well known for its high capacity to secrete proteins into the extracellular milieu, which has led to its exploitation as a \"cell factory\" for secreted proteins. Nevertheless, the secretion of heterologous proteins of pharmaceutical importance is frequently inefficient. This applied problem has been a major incentive for fundamental research on the mechanisms of protein transport in B. subtilis. For this purpose, molecular biological, phylogenetic, genomic and proteomic techniques were employed in an integrated way to study the mechanisms of protein secretion in B. subtilis. More recently Systems Biological approaches were implemented for the research on protein secretion, including so-called live cell array technology. Important research outcomes were: (i) characterisation of a Gram-positive Tat pathway for protein transport; (ii) novel insights in the roles of lipid-modification in membrane-attachment and function of lipoproteins of Gram-positive bacteria; (iii) a strategy for improved disulphide bond formation in secreted proteins; (iv) description of the B. subtilis response to protein overproduction and secretion stress; and (v) bioinformatic and proteomic descriptions of the B. subtilis secretome. Ongoing research is focused on the dynamic behaviour of the secretome in response to changing environmental conditions.\r\n\r\nStaphylococcus aureus is an important hospital- and community-acquired opportunistic pathogen. Recent research on protein sorting and secretion in S. aureus has yielded a state-of-the-art roadmap of the S. aureus secretome. The secretome map includes both protein transport pathways and the extracytoplasmic proteins. This has resulted in overviews of the exported virulence factors, pathways for protein transport, signals for cellular protein retention or secretion, and the exoproteomes of clinical S. aureus isolates. Importantly, the results include a first definition of the core and variant secretomes of S. aureus. While the core secretome seems to be largely employed for general house-keeping functions, necessary to thrive in particular niches provided by the human host, the variant secretome seems to contain the \"gadgets\" that S. aureus needs to conquer these well-protected niches (Sibbald et al., 2006). Ongoing research is aimed at analysing how the different secretion pathways of S. aureus impact on exoproteome biogenesis, fitness, resistance to antibiotics, adhesion to biomaterials and cell components, biofilm formation and virulence.\r\n\n\n\nDATA_FILES\nThe condition-dependent transcriptome of Bacillus subtilis 168\nINSTITUTIONS\nUniversity Medical Centre Groningen\nPROJECTS\nBaCell-SysMO\nPUBLICATIONS\nThe twin-arginine translocation (Tat) systems from Bacillus subtilis display a conserved mode of complex organization and similar substrate recognition requirements\nInterchangeable modules in bacterial thiol-disulfide exchange pathways\nModulation of thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases for increased production of disulfide-bond-containing proteins in Bacillus subtilis\nGenetic or chemical protease inhibition causes significant changes in the Bacillus subtilis exoproteome\nTowards the development of Bacillus subtilis as a cell factory for membrane proteins and protein complexes\nImmunity to the bacteriocin sublancin 168 Is determined by the SunI (YolF) protein of Bacillus subtilis\nOverflow of a hyper-produced secretory protein from the Bacillus Sec pathway into the Tat pathway for protein secretion as revealed by proteogenomics\nMscL of Bacillus subtilis prevents selective release of cytoplasmic proteins in a hypotonic environment\nThe large mechanosensitive channel MscL determines bacterial susceptibility to the bacteriocin sublancin 168\nApplications of thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases for optimized in vivo production of functionally active proteins in Bacillus\nContributions of the pre- and pro-regions of a Staphylococcus hyicus lipase to secretion of a heterologous protein by Bacillus subtilis\nProtein transport across and into cell membranes in bacteria and archaea\nStress-responsive systems set specific limits to the overproduction of membrane proteins in Bacillus subtilis\nRecombination between ccrC genes in a type V (5C2&5) staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) of Staphylococcus aureus ST398 leads to conversion from methicillin resistance to methicillin susceptibility in vivo\nRequirement of the agr locus for colony spreading of Staphylococcus aureus\nStaphylococcal PknB as the first prokaryotic representative of the proline-directed kinases\nCondition-dependent transcriptome reveals high-level regulatory architecture in Bacillus subtilis\nFunctional analysis of the sortase YhcS in Bacillus subtilis\nEnvironmental salinity determines the specificity and need for Tat-dependent secretion of the YwbN protein in Bacillus subtilis\nNovel twin-arginine translocation pathway-dependent phenotypes of Bacillus subtilis unveiled by quantitative proteomics\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nMalate metabolism in Bacillus subtilis: distinct roles for three classes of malate-oxidizing enzymes(id: 188 | type: publications)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nPEOPLE\nJoerg Stuelke\nLeif Steil\nPROJECTS\nBaCell-SysMO\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nWhat makes the lac-pathway switch: identifying the fluctuations that trigger phenotype switching in gene regulatory systems(id: 229 | type: publications)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nPEOPLE\nRobin Sorg\nJan-Willem Veening\nJohannes Berg\nPrasanna    Bhogale\nPROJECTS\nNoisy-Strep\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nTrophozoite Isolation and Lysate Preparation(id: 205 | type: sops)\n\nDescription: SOP for the isolation of intact Plasmodium falciparum trophozoites from infected red blood cells and the preparation of a cell free extract that can be used for kinetic analyses.\n\n\nCREATORS\nDawie Van Niekerk\nJacky Snoep\nPEOPLE\nJacky Snoep\nDawie Van Niekerk\nPROJECTS\nWhole body modelling of glucose metabolism in malaria patients\nSUBMITTER\nDawie Van Niekerk\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nsigB-response_starvation_shakeflask(id: 20 | type: models)\n\nDescription: The model can simulate the the dynamics of sigB dependent transcription at the transition to starvation.

Furthermore, comprehensive information on cell and molecular biology, physiology and genetics is available and the European Bacillus community (BACELL) has a well-established reputation for applying this information and technologies to address fundamental issues in life sciences. \r\nBeyond its scientific relevance B. subtilis is an industrial workhorse of “white biotechnology” as a main producer of technical enzymes and other products.\r\nIn the first funding period we have used a systems biology approach to analyze the transition from exponential phase to stationary phase. Within the context of this project we have analyzed both modules of gene expression as well as metabolic changes. One of the major findings was the discovery that metabolic and regulatory activities do not appear to be dispersed in the cell, but rather exist in defined and distinct protein complexes. The complexes that we have detected in B. subtilis include the glycolytic enzymes PFK, PGM, and ENO (the glycosome) and an RNA degrading machine, the degradosome. These findings contrast with the text-book view that many processes occur in dedicated compartments in eukaryotic cells, whereas little internal structure is present in prokaryotes. However, the existence of such complexes has major consequences for our understanding of the biology of B. subtilis and other bacteria since they may affect the local concentrations of not just the metabolites, but also the proteins themselves within a given pathway and thus impact on the reaction kinetics. \r\nTherefore, we want to concentrate our efforts in the second funding period onto the elucidation of the contribution of protein complexes to the function of central carbon and nitrogen metabolism during nutrient shifts and environmental adaptations. The analysis of the impact of metabolic complexes on cellular physiology is highly relevant and an excellent topic for systems biology. So far, it has been possible to model metabolism of B. subtilis with the inherent assumption that both metabolites and enzymes are more or less evenly distributed in the cell. However, since the existence of enzyme complexes would have a dramatic impact on the kinetics of the reactions and the relevant local concentrations of metabolites, we would like to address the so far largely unexplored but important issue of (micro)compartmentalisation using a new set of experimental and modelling approaches.  We will combine experimental monitoring of in vivo complexes with conventional metabolic modelling to identify nodes in which protein complexes are functionally important. These complexes and their dynamics will then be studied in detail by a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches up to crystallization of selected complexes to provide data which will allow refinement of the models generated.\r\nMain goals\r\n-\tElucidation of the functional importance of protein complexes for the physiology of B. subtilis using its central metabolism as example\r\n-\tContribution to the general understanding of metabolic compartments in bacteria, leading to new strategies for metabolic modeling that take the existence and importance of such complexes into account\r\n-\tProviding a framework for the analysis of functionally important protein complexes that can then be extended to other bacteria including related low-GC Gram-positive pathogens\r\n\n\n\nASSAYS\nGene expression(Transcriptome)\nmetabolome-LCMS\n2D-gelbased analysis of intracellular proteins\nRelative quantification of proteins by metabolic labeling\nAbsolute quantification of proteins by the AQUA-technology\nIPTG induction of sigmaB in BSA115\nB. subtilis Transcription Factor Competition -

The original model was designed to investigate how canal cells can accumulate auxin over time rather than to investigate the transport of auxin through the canal cells per se. The main outputs of the simulations in the original paper were the steady state ratios of auxin in the canal cell protoplasts to that in the parenchyma cell protoplasts for different cell sizes and AUX/LAX auxin carrier distributions.\tNote that the working version of the model is in the Simile (.sml) version rather than in XML (which is a temporary holding dummy file).&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Related Publications</strong></strong><br>Kramer E.M.

By connecting fields such as genomics, proteomics, cell biology, medicine, molecular biology, biochemistry and genetics, with mathematics, bioinformatics, engineering and computation, it enables discovery of yet unknown principles underlying the functioning of living cells. At the same time testable and predictive models of complex cellular pathways and eventually of whole cells are generated, which are useful for efficient experimental design and bioengineering and the network-based design of drugs and therapies. This advanced lecture course will cover essential and state-of-the-art aspects of SysBio from principles and methods through the modeling of living systems to applications in biotechnology and medicine. \r\nCourse opens the doors for regular student training in Systems Biology in Europe, provide a basis for a human network of young Systems Biology experts, and provide a centre for other Systems Biology discussions between scientists and funders.\r\nSysMO DB team will represent Data mangement in praxis.\n\n\nPROJECTS\nSysMO DB\nSUBMITTER\nOlga Krebs\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nMetabolic fluxes and beyond-systems biology understanding and engineering of microbial metabolism(id: 158 | type: publications)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nPEOPLE\nLeif Steil\nChristoph Wittmann\nMichael Kohlstedt\nPROJECTS\nBaCell-SysMO\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nGene knock-outs by recombineering in E.coli.(id: 20 | type: sops)\n\nDescription: Generating gene knock-outs using DY330 expressing the defective lambdoid prophage recombination system λ red.\n\n\nCREATORS\nLisbeth Lyngberg\nPEOPLE\nLisbeth Lyngberg\nPROJECTS\nKOSMOBAC\nSUBMITTER\nLisbeth Lyngberg\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nA gating model for the potassium efflux systems KefB and KefC(id: 40 | type: sops)\n\nDescription: A kinetic model that describess the activation of a dimeric efflux system that could bind either GSH or SLG\n\n\nCREATORS\nLisbeth Lyngberg\nPEOPLE\nLisbeth Lyngberg\nPROJECTS\nKOSMOBAC\nSUBMITTER\nLisbeth Lyngberg\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nNested autoinhibitory feedbacks alter the resistance of homeostatic adaptive biochemical networks(id: 238 | type: publications)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nPEOPLE\nJörg Schaber\nPROJECTS\nICYSB 2015 - International Practical Course in Systems Biology\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nAutomated Flow Cytometry Data Analysis(id: 5 | type: presentations)\n\nDescription: Presentation by Thomas Millat of a tool for automatized analysis of flow cytometry data.

To optimise the proportion of useful sequence, while including RNA fragments that are products of of degradation, rRNA is depleted using the eukaryotic Ribominus kit (Ambion). Two biological replicates are treated with Sinefungin and Actinomycin D to inhibit RNA processing and transcription, for different time periods. RNA is collected before treatment, 5 min after the addition of Sinefungin, 5 min after addition of ActD (+Sin), then 10 min after, 20, 30, 60 and 120 min. The samples are sequenced using the Illumina standard protocol, and the sequenced reads are aligned to the reference genome TREU927, and the number of reads aligned to each ORF are determined. \n\n\nASSAYS\nmRNA decay assay\npre-mRNA processing rate\nModelling the gene expression cascade with length-dependent processes\nDATA_FILES\nmRNA decay\nHalf life values for enzymes of redox and polyamine pathways as provided by Alejandro\nmRNA half-lives\nprecursor mRNA half-lives\nINVESTIGATION\nGene expression in Trypanosoma brucei\nPEOPLE\nAbeer Fadda\nChristine Clayton\nPROJECTS\nSilicoTryp\nPUBLICATIONS\nTranscriptome-wide analysis of trypanosome mRNA decay reveals complex degradation kinetics and suggests a role for co-transcriptional degradation in determining mRNA levels\nSOPS\nSample preparation for mRNA decay study\nSUBMITTER\nAbeer Fadda\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nT2011 Ostreococcus clock, CCA1 degr L - PLM_85, version 1, SIMPLIFIED(id: 514 | type: models)\n\nDescription: Simplified model file for PLaSMo accession ID PLM_85, version 1 (use simplified if your software cannot read the file, e.g. Sloppy Cell)\n\n\nASSAYS\nT2011 Ostreococcus clock, CCA1 degr L - PLM_85, version 1\nCREATORS\nBioData SynthSys\nINVESTIGATIONS\nTroein, Carl\nPEOPLE\nBioData SynthSys\nPROJECTS\nPlaSMo model repository\nSTUDIES\nT2011 Ostreococcus clock, CCA1 degr L - PLM_85\nSUBMITTER\nBioData SynthSys\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nK+ Starvation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae(id: 10 | type: investigations)\n\nDescription: Experimental approaches to evaluate cellular response to Potassium limitation.

LHY) and multiple light inputs. It was used and described in Troein et al., Plant Journal (2011).\n\tThe model incorporates luciferase reporters, and in this SBML model the four different versions of the model for transcriptional and translational reporter lines (pTOC1::LUC, pCCA1::LUC, TOC1-LUC and CCA1-LUC) are all accessible by setting one of the rep_X parameters to 1 and the others to 0. You can also set all four to 0 to only simulate the non-reporter core of the system.\n\tInput to the system should be provided by modifying the &quot;light&quot; function. The functions &quot;ox_cca1&quot; and &quot;ox_toc1&quot; can be altered to add overexpression of CCA1 and TOC1. Setting either to x gives additional, constitutive transcription at x times the transcription rate that the native gene has when the Shea-Ackers quotient equals 1. The functions &quot;copies_toc1&quot; and &quot;copies_cca1&quot; are normally 1 but can be lowered to simulate knockdown experiments. The functions &quot;transcription&quot;, &quot;translation&quot; and &quot;proteasome&quot; can be used to modify the overall rate of transcription, translation and protein degradation.\n\tThe parameters were fitted specifically to data from transgenic reporter lines TOC8, pTOC3, LHY7 and pLHY7 (Corellou et al., Plant Cell 2009). Parameters that begin with &quot;effcopies&quot; describe the effective number of copies of CCA1 or TOC1 in the respective translational fusion lines, with anything above 1 due to the fusion proteins.\n\tFor the model fitting, the initial values were fitted to the data in the various time courses. The initial values given here correspond to the limit cycle of the system in LD 12:12. The system converges to the limit cycle in just a few days under most light conditions, so these initial values are biologically meaningful.\n\tThe species cca1luc_c and cca1luc_n have been merged into cca1luc (which corresponds to the observable signal), because Copasi refused to run the system otherwise. For TOC1-LUC, the predicted signal is the sum of toc1luc_1 and toc1luc_2.</p>\n<br><br><strong>Originally submitted to PLaSMo on 2010-05-04 11:27:33</strong></strong>\n\n\nCREATORS\nBioData SynthSys\nINVESTIGATION\nTroein, Carl\nMODELS\nTroein Ostreococcus clock 1-loop - PLM_7, version 1, SUBMITTED\nTroein Ostreococcus clock 1-loop - PLM_7, version 1, SIMPLIFIED\nPEOPLE\nBioData SynthSys\nPROJECTS\nPlaSMo model repository\nSTUDY\nTroein Ostreococcus clock 1-loop - PLM_7\nSUBMITTER\nBioData SynthSys\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCompartimented ODE model of oxygen diffusion near E. coli cells(id: 91 | type: models)\n\nDescription: This ordinary-differential equation model is a spatially lumped model showing the behaviour of oxygen in the three compartments medium, membrane and cytoplasm and its impact on FNR inactivation, hereby showing the effects of different oxygen concentrations, diffusion coefficients and reaction rates.

Since transcription regulation is non-existent with few exceptions, the rate of pre-mRNA processing, together with mRNA decay and translation rates, are believed to control gene expression. In this assay, 2T1 blood form trypanosomes are subject to treatment by ActinomycinD for 5 minutes, inhibiting transcription. The cells are harvested, depleted for ribosomal RNA, and sent for deep sequencing. 2 biological replicates have been processed. Reads that align to 20 bp just upstream of 5' splice sites, are believed to correspond to pre-mRNA. The number of reads is compared to a control sample, and the rate of processing is calculated assuming an exponential profile. \r\nThe results for blood form Trypanosomes will be compared to the results from 2 replicates for the procyclic form. Differences will be linked to differences in mature mRNA abundances between the two forms.\n\n\nINVESTIGATION\nGene expression in Trypanosoma brucei\nORGANISMS\nTrypanosoma brucei\nPEOPLE\nAbeer Fadda\nPROJECTS\nSilicoTryp\nPUBLICATIONS\nTranscriptome-wide analysis of trypanosome mRNA decay reveals complex degradation kinetics and suggests a role for co-transcriptional degradation in determining mRNA levels\nSTUDY\nDetermination and integration of abundance, processing efficiency, and degradation kinetics of the mRNAs encoding all T. brucei redox and pentose\r\nphosphate pathway enzymes\nSUBMITTER\nAbeer Fadda\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nNew SEEK features (presentation at last PALs meeing in Heidelberg on 27th of August)(id: 11 | type: presentations)\n\nDescription: The presentation of new features in SEEK at last PALs meeing in Heidelberg on 27th of August by David, Lihua and Quyen\n\n\nCREATORS\nOlga Krebs\nEVENTS\nAll Hands SySMO PALs  meeting \nPEOPLE\nOlga Krebs\nPROJECTS\nSysMO DB\nSUBMITTER\nOlga Krebs\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nAnalysis of proton and potassium fluxes(id: 12 | type: studies)\n\nDescription: Cells are starved.

In my group we worked parallel on human cells and plant cells, making use of their similarity in mechanisms and their complementary experimental approaches. In addition we have analyse the dynamics and molecular mechanisms of the formation in living cells of multi-protein complexes on the DNA that are responsible for DNA repair after UV damage.\r\nIn these studies we collaborated with different physicists in making predictive computational models based on quantitative experimental data.

Starting from experimental information, the model construction and underlying assumptions are explained. Furthermore, the required additions to the metabolic and genetic network caused by the used experimentals setup are established.\r\n\r\nThe established metabolic and genetic model is compared to dynamic shift experiments starting at acidogenesis and solventogenesis. We show that this phase transition of C. acetobutylicum is associated to a cellular adaptation of the proteome. However, the dynamics during those transition is reproduced insufficiently.\r\n\r\nThe external pH is crucial for the behaviour of C. acetobutylicum, hence implications to the pH-dependent product spectrum of branch points in the ABE fermentation pathway are discussed. The comparison between simulations and experimental data reveals that further information about the pH-dependent kinetic regulation of the pathway are required for an improvement of the model.\n\n\nCREATORS\nThomas Millat\nPEOPLE\nThomas Millat\nPROJECTS\nCOSMIC\nPUBLICATIONS\nA proteomic and transcriptional view of acidogenic and solventogenic steady-state cells of Clostridium acetobutylicum in a chemostat culture\nA systems biology approach to investigate the effect of pH-induced gene regulation on solvent production by Clostridium acetobutylicum in continuous culture\nGenome-wide gene expression analysis of the switch between acidogenesis and solventogenesis in continuous cultures of Clostridium acetobutylicum\nSUBMITTER\nThomas Millat\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe Glyoxalase pathway model(id: 39 | type: sops)\n\nDescription: The model describes the series of chemical reactions in MG detoxification pathway, allowing one to predict the flux of all compounds produced during detoxification.\n\n\nCREATORS\nLisbeth Lyngberg\nPEOPLE\nLisbeth Lyngberg\nPROJECTS\nKOSMOBAC\nSUBMITTER\nLisbeth Lyngberg\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nBert Poolman(id: 38 | type: people)\n\nDescription: Bert Poolman is professor in biochemistry and program director of the Centre for Synthetic Biology. His research focuses on the elucidation of the mechanisms by which signals are transduced and small molecules are translocated across cellular membranes. Cells are reengineered for the production of correctly folded membrane proteins, and methods are developed to reconstitute complex molecular assemblies in synthetic membranes and to analyze their functional and structural properties. The in vitro mechanistic studies are used to strengthen in vivo physiological measurements and vice versa. Research topics in his group include: (i) the mechanisms of translocation catalysis by ATP-binding cassette transporters; (ii) the molecular basis of cell volume regulation, incl. a comprehensive understanding of the role of lipid-protein interactions, (macro)molecular crowding and other generic physicochemical factors in transmembrane signaling and transport; and (iii) membrane proteomics with a focus on nuclear and vacuolar membranes and the basis for molecule transport through the nuclear pore complex.\n\n\nINSTITUTIONS\nUniversity of Groningen\nPROJECTS\nKOSMOBAC\nPUBLICATIONS\nMolecular sieving properties of the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli and consequences of osmotic stress\nMacromolecule diffusion and confinement in prokaryotic cells\nProtein mobility and diffusive barriers in Escherichia coli: consequences of osmotic stress\nThe role of biomacromolecular crowding, ionic strength, and physicochemical gradients in the complexities of life's emergence\nStructural basis for the enhanced activity of cyclic antimicrobial peptides: The case of BPC194\nThe molecular basis for antimicrobial activity of pore-forming cyclic peptides\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nFunctional potentials of human hematopoietic progenitor cells are maintained by mesenchymal stromal cells and not impaired by plerixafor(id: 282 | type: publications)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nINVESTIGATIONS\nWP5: Translational Application for the Characterization and ex vivo Expansion of Human Erythroid Progenitor Cells\nPEOPLE\nMaja Rey\nRainer Saffrich\nPROJECTS\nSBEpo - Systems Biology of Erythropoietin\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nTest created 1552502791700(id: 958 | type: assays)\n\nDescription: <br><br><strong>Related Publications</strong></strong><br>Me and Helena (2014). some book. <br>Moore A, Zielinski T, Millar AJ (2014).

Cellular and extracellular changes like crowding and osmotic stress conditions play a major role in protein aggregation. A change in the cytoplasmic composition is the result of an interplay between high osmotic pressures outside the cell volume and the cellular response to it in terms of uptake of K+ and secondary organic osmolytes. My research focuses on elucidating the role of natural osmolytes (known also as chemical chaperones or compatible solutes) that modulate protein aggregation propensity. I am using fluorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and several biochemical and biophysical methods to understand the effect of different osmolytes to counteract cellular crowing and their influence on the mobility of different protein aggregate species. \r\n\r\n\n\n\nINSTITUTIONS\nMax-Planck-Institute of Biochemistry Martinsried\nPROJECTS\nKOSMOBAC\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nAnalysis of potassium efflux from Escherichia coli using flame photometry(id: 34 | type: sops)\n\nDescription: Measurements of K+ retained in the cytoplasm using flame photometry.\n\n\nCREATORS\nLisbeth Lyngberg\nPEOPLE\nLisbeth Lyngberg\nPROJECTS\nKOSMOBAC\nSUBMITTER\nLisbeth Lyngberg\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nTools for systems biology modeling and data exchange 2018(id: 117 | type: events)\n\nDescription: During this 3-day course, attendees will learn basic techniques for modeling of biochemical networks including data access and storage due to the FAIR principles.

This will enable us to identify other areas of the metabolome influenced by, or influencing, oxidative stress and will allow us to compare changes in each of the stress-inducing stimuli. We have recently pioneered untargeted metabolite profiling of T. brucei using ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry (Kamleh et al. 2008 PMID: 18470888). This will link directly to the modelling in WP1 by providing the high-accuracy metabolome data for the ab inito networks. We have, so far, been able to identify in the order of 400 metabolites in trypanosomes using a single, simple sample preparation protocol. The untargeted metabolite approach enables perturbations to multiple parts of the cellular metabolome to be assessed in a single experiment and also point to changes in metabolism secondary to inhibition of target enzymes. For example, changes to NADP/NADPH balance can affect other biochemical pathways i.e. secondary effects will ripple out through the metabolome as a consequence of primary changes. Data obtained on changes to metabolite levels will be compared to dynamic changes in transcript and protein levels. In this manner we hope to extend our knowledge of pathways involved in oxidative stress defence, beyond the already established pathways involved in trypanothione production.\n\n\nASSAYS\nMetabolite profiling on T. brucei exposed to oxidative stress\nIntracellular metabolite concentrations in T. brucei exposed to oxidative stress\nDATA_FILES\nMetabolic changes by oxidative stress in T. b. brucei 427\nAbsolute intracellular concentrations of metabolites extracted from T. b. brucei 427 exposed to methylene blue\nINVESTIGATION\nMetabolite profiling, quantification and flux quantification\nPEOPLE\nDong-Hyun Kim\nPROJECTS\nSilicoTryp\nSOPS\nSample preparation for intracellular metabolite extraction in T. b. brucei 427\nSUBMITTER\nDong-Hyun Kim\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nSUMO mRNA isolation Epicentre(id: 80 | type: sops)\n\nDescription: This file describes how to isolate mRNA from E. coli using the kit from Epicentre, for gene expression analysis via RT-PCR\n\n\nASSAYS\nAnalysis of gene expression rates at different aerobiosis levels via RT-PCR\nCharacterization of MG1655 and mutant strains under conditions of glucose excess and limitation.\nAerobic and anaerobic characterization of MG1655 and mutant strains with regard to transcription profiles.\nGene expression analysis of mutants with linear electron transport chain at different aerobiosis levels\nCREATORS\nSonja Steinsiek\nINVESTIGATIONS\nSteady state studies for different oxygen availability in Escherichia coli\nAnalysis of the glucose transport in Escherichia coli under aerobic and anaerobic conditions\nAnalysis of Escherichia coli with linear electron transport chain\nPEOPLE\nSonja Steinsiek\nPROJECTS\nSUMO\nSTUDIES\nDetermination of the impact of specific enzyme reactions and regulatory proteins using isogenic E. coli mutant strains\nCharacterization of mutant strains with defects in sugar transport systems\nAnalysis of Escherichia coli strains with linear respiratory chain\nSUBMITTER\nSonja Steinsiek\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nDynamic interplay between nuclei and mitochondria in ageing cells(id: 136 | type: projects)\n\nDescription: We will systematically analyse large datasets of multiple types to: (i) identify key components\r\naffected by age or experimental perturbation; (ii) establish networks of interaction; (iii) develop dynamic\r\ncomputational models based on these networks; (iv) use model selection methods to discriminate between\r\nalternative network topologies and generate predictive models. To characterise the data, we will apply an\r\nensemble of methods, including frameworks in R/Bioconductor and toolboxes connected via APIs, algorithms for\r\nmachine learning and deep learning, mutual information, Bayesian inference and various cluster analysis. Each\r\nstrategy will be assessed for quality of output, efficiency, ease of use and maintainability. We will develop full\r\ninteraction networks by employing a different set of multi-strategy workflows on enhanced data sets\r\nsupplemented with data generated from cell cultures and in-vitro model systems upon perturbation. This will\r\nrequire the development of novel multi-workflows to enable data integration and analysis of temporal\r\nrelationships across age and/or biological processes. Strategies will employ suites of apps within Cytoscape\r\nas well as emerging technologies such as Active Interaction Mapping where network\r\nconnections are driven by function. The outputs will be used to inform the network topology of computational\r\nmodels of molecular mechanisms and cellular processes.\n\n\nINSTITUTIONS\nUniversity of Newcastle\nUniversity of Copenhagen\nNational Institute on Aging\nPEOPLE\nDaryl Shanley\nAlvaro Martinez Guimera\nLene Juel Rasmussen\nDeborah Croteau\nVilhelm Bohr\nAna Serrano Puebla\nPROGRAMMES\nNewcastle University Systems Modelling of Ageing\nPUBLICATIONS\nNAD + Replenishment Improves Lifespan and Healthspan in Ataxia Telangiectasia Models via Mitophagy and DNA Repair\nRev1 contributes to proper mitochondrial function via the PARP-NAD+-SIRT1-PGC1α axis\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nRichard (1996) Concentrations of oscillating glycolytic intermediates in yeast cultures(id: 998 | type: data_files)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nASSAYS\nDetailed kinetic model of yeast glycolytic oscillation\nMetabolite concentrations in yeast glycolytic oscillations\nCREATORS\nFranco Du Preez\nJacky Snoep\nINVESTIGATIONS\nYeast Glycolytic Oscillations\nPEOPLE\nJacky Snoep\nFranco Du Preez\nPROJECTS\nSysMO DB\nPUBLICATIONS\nFrom steady-state to synchronized yeast glycolytic oscillations I: model construction\nSTUDIES\nDetailed kinetics of yeast glycolytic oscillation\nSUBMITTER\nFranco Du Preez\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nRNA-Seq(id: 143 | type: assays)\n\nDescription: S.pneumoniae D39 cells (wild type and delta greA) were grown in C+Y medium and cells were harvested for total RNA isolation at mid-exponential growth (OD600nm 0.3 for wt, 0.25 for delta greA). Total RNA was isolated as described before (Kloosterman et al 2006).\r\nThe total RNA samples were examined by capillary electrophoresis.\r\ndephosphorylated with antarctic phosphatase followed by treatment with polynucleotide kinase (PNK).\r\nAfterwards, samples were poly(A)-tailed using poly(A) polymerase. Then a RNA adapter was ligated to\r\nthe 5´-phosphate of the RNA fragments. First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using an\r\noligo(dT)-adapter primer and the M-MLV reverse transcriptase. The resulting cDNAs were PCRamplified\r\nto about 30 ng/μl using a high fidelity DNA polymerase. PCR cycles performed and barcode\r\nsequences, which are part of the 3' TruSeq sequencing adapter, are included in Table 2. The cDNAs\r\nwere purified using the Agencourt AMPure XP kit (Beckman Coulter Genomics) and analyzed by\r\ncapillary electrophoresis.\r\nFor Illumina sequencing, the cDNA in the size range of 300 - 500 bp was eluted from preparative\r\nagarose gels. Aliquots of the size fractionated cDNA were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis.\r\nThe cDNAs are double stranded and have a size of about 300 – 500 bp. The primers used for PCR\r\namplification were designed for TruSeq sequencing according to the instructions of Illumina.\r\nThe following adapter sequences flank the cDNA inserts:\r\nTrueSeq_Sense_primer\r\n5´- AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT-3’\r\nTrueSeq_Antisense_primer Barcode\r\n5’-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGAT-NNNNNN-GTGACTGGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATC(dT25)-3’\r\nThe combined length of the flanking sequences is 146 bases.\r\nProperties of cDNA samples\r\nNo. 1 2\r\nSample WT greA\r\nBarcode ATCACG CGATGT\r\nPCR cycles 12 12\r\n\r\nFor sequencing, the two cDNA samples were pooled in approximately equimolar amounts.The cDNA\r\npool was then sequenced on a Illumina HiSeq 2000 system.\r\n\r\nWT 110901_SN865_B_L006_R1_GQC-28-\r\nATCACG.fastq.gz\r\n100 19.624.852 1,29\r\ngreA 110901_SN865_B_L006_R1_GQC-28-\r\nCGATGT.fastq.gz\r\n100 20.632.085 1,31\r\n\r\nllumina fastq format\r\n4 lines for each sequence:\r\n1- Unique identifier, with the following format:\r\n@<machine_id>:<lane>:<tile>:<x_coord>:<y_coord>#<index>/<read_#>\r\n2- Sequence (A, T, C ,G or N (undetermined) only)\r\n3- Orientation (always forward without mapping)\r\n4- Quality value for each base, corresponding to a Phred-like score encoded in ASCII format, with an\r\noffset of of 33 (e.g. “J” gives a value of 41) and is in accordance with sanger FASTQ format.\r\nThe sequence file is compressed as tar.gz archive.

Preparation of B. subtilis cultures\r\n\r\n    Inoculate cells from -80°C stocks in 10 ml time-lapse microscopy (TLM) medium (62 mM K2HPO4 , 44mM KH2PO4, 15 mM (NH4)2SO4, 6.5 mM sodium citrate, 0.8 mM MgSO4, 0.02 % casamino acids, 27.8 mM glucose, 0.1 mM L-tryptophan, the pH was set to 7 using a KOH solution) supplemented with antibiotics, if necessary.\r\n    Grow the cells overnight in a shake flask (30°C, 225 rpm).\r\n    The following morning, dilute the cells 1:10 in pre-warmed chemically defined medium (CDM) (62 mM K2HPO4, 44mM KH2PO4, 15 mM (NH4)2SO4, 6.5 mM sodium citrate, 0.8 mM MgSO4, 2.2mM glucose, 2.1 mM L-glutamic acid, 6 μM L-tryptophan, 7.5 μM MnCl2, 0.15 x metal mix (prepare 50x MT mix stock (ref 8) which contains: 0.2 M MgCl2, 70 mM CaCl2, 5 mM MnCI2, 0.1 mM ZnCl2, 0.2 mM thiamin-hydrochloride, 2 mM HCl, 0.5 mM FeCl3 (add last)) without antibiotics.\r\n    Grow the B. subtilis cells to mid-exponential phase (30°C, 225 rpm). Usually, this takes approximately four hours. Importantly, prepare the agarose slide one hour before the cells reach mid-exponential phase (see section 2).\r\n    Measure the absorbance of the culture at 600nm (A600) and dilute the cells to an approximate A600 of 0.035 using CDM. This OD ensures that single cells with appropriate spacing are spotted on the microscope slide for time-lapse microscopy.\r\n\r\n2. Preparation of the microscope sample (also see Figure 2)\r\n\r\nOne hour before cells reach mid-exponential growth, prepare the microscope slide as follows:\r\n\r\n    Clean two microscope glass slides (e.g. Knittel Glass, 7.6 x 2.6 cm,) with 70% ethanol and water.\r\n    Take a gene frame (ABgene; 1.7 x 2.8 cm) and carefully remove one of the plastic foils from the gene frame without causing disassembly of the plastic cover on the other side of the gene frame.\r\n    Attach the gene frame in the middle of one of the glass slides by first facilitating contact on just one side, followed by guided attachment of the remaining gene frame with a fingernail. Prevent air bubbles while attaching the gene frame to the glass slide.\r\n    Use a microwave to dissolve 150 mg (1.5%) high-resolution low-melting agarose (Sigma) in 10 ml CDM. The agarose needs to be fully dissolved to obtain minimal background required for the time-lapse microscopy experiments. If required, supplement the agarose-CDM with inducer or other compounds at this time\r\n    Transfer 500 μl of the warm agarose-CDM in the middle of the gene frame. Make sure the whole area including (the borders) is fully covered.\r\n    The following steps (2.6 - 2.10) have to be carried out quickly to prevent excessive drying of the agarose-CDM.\r\n    Place the second glass slide on the agarose-CDM filled gene frame. Try to avoid air bubbles. Place the sandwiched slides in a horizontal position for 45 min at 4°C in the refrigerator to allow the agarose-CDM to solidify sufficiently.\r\n    Carefully slide off the upper glass slide. Use a razor blade to cut out agar strips of ~5 mm width within the gene frame, on which the cells will be grown. A maximum of three strips can be used per slide, separated by ~4 mm space to either side. These spaces will provide air which is essential for B. subtilis growth. If four different strains need to be followed in time, two strips can be made and be cut in half to result in four small squares. Remove any residual solid medium.\r\n    Carefully remove the second and final plastic cover from the gene frame to expose the sticky side of the gene frame\r\n    Load single cells (from step 1.5) on the solid medium without touching it with the pipet tip. Use 2.5 μl for a whole strip, or 1 μl for a small square. Always start on top of the agarose pad and allow the liquid to disperse equally on its assigned growth area by turning the slide up and down. The slide is ready, as soon as the edges of the liquid become corrugated and movement of the liquid is no longer visible when turning the slide.\r\n    Place a clean microscope slide cover slip (24 x 50 mm) on the gene frame from one side to the other (avoid air bubbles). Assure complete attachment by applying pressure on the cover slip along the gene frame with your fingernail. If the cover slip is placed on the cells without allowing them to dry long enough, cells tend to grow on top of each other during the experiment. Also be careful not to wait too long before applying the cover slip, since the agarose will then be too dry.\r\n    Pre-warm the slide for 1 h at 30°C. If the slide would directly be placed in the pre-warmed environmental chamber (see step 3.1) of the microscope, the temperature fluctuations might cause autofocus problems in the first hours of the experiment.\r\n\r\n3. Time-lapse fluorescence microscopy (also see Figure 3 and Movie 1)\r\n\r\n    Pre-warm the environmental chamber on time (in our hands at least 2h before the start of the experiment) in order to prevent autofocus problems after starting the experiment. The time required depends on the environmental chamber used as well as the heating system and the microscope.\r\n    Select the appropriate objective, filters and dichroic mirror according to your experimental set-up. For long experiments make sure that a UV-filter is placed between the light source and the sample. Also, if possible, block some of the excitation light using neutral density filters to minimize exposure.\r\n\r\nThe following equipment (provided by DeltaVision, UK) was used for the time-lapse microscopy experiments published in de Jong et al. 2010 5: IX71 Microscope (Olympus), CoolSNAP HQ2 camera (Princeton Instruments), 300W Xenon Light Source, 60x bright field objective (1.25 NA), GFP filterset (Chroma, excitation at 470/40 nm, emission 525/50 nm), mCherry filterset (Chroma, excitation at 572/35 nm, emission 632/60 nm). Autofocus was performed using diascopic light and using the autofocus routine present in Deltavision's Softworx software. It should be noted that there are now a number of other autofocus systems that are also suitable such as the Zeiss Definite Focus, the Nikon Perfect Focus System and the Leica Adaptive Focus Control.\r\n\r\n    Program your experiment according to your experimental set-up. It is wise to determine the amount of light required for specific constructs, as well as the autofocus settings for other time-lapse microscopes or bacteria prior to the actual experiment. Shorter exposure times and less amount of excitation light will minimize bleaching and phototoxicity. Use diascopic light for the autofocus routine.\r\n\r\nThe following settings were used for the time-lapse microscopy experiments published in de Jong et al. 2010 5: snapshots for movies were taken at intervals of 8 or 12 minutes using 10 % APLLC White LED light and 0.05 s exposure for bright field pictures, 10% Xenon light and 0.5 s exposure for GFP detection, and 32% Xenon light and 0.8 s exposure for mCherry detection, respectively. Raw data were stored using softWoRx 3.6.0 (Applied Presicion). The autofocus was programmed for 0.06 μm steps and a total range of 1.2 μm.\r\n\r\n    Place the prepared slide (section 2) in the pre-warmed environmental chamber of the microscope and monitor the outgrowth of single cells into a microcolony monolayer at 30°C.\r\n\r\nSpecific tips:\r\n\r\n    Select single cells that are located in the middle of the agar pad. The edges of the agar pad dry out more easily. Store the X,Y,Z position using the microscope's software.\r\n    Large movements of the stage in the X,Y and Z direction might perturb the agarose and consequently hamper identification of cells by the autofocus routine. In general, to minimize X,Y,Z movement, we do not select more than 10 positions per experiment even if a slide contains multiple strains.\r\n    After having selected the first cell, only adjust the Z-focus with the software. From this point, do not alter the focus manually on the microscope body using the \"Z-knob\" unless this is digitally encoded. Ensure that after each autofocus routine the new X,Y,Z position is stored by the software.\r\n    Check whether the autofocus settings are appropriate for the experiment, before starting the run. The use of phase-contrast microscopy might improve the autofocus routine compared to using brightfield or DIC microscopy, due to enhanced contrast. However, the phase ring in phase-contrast objectives makes them less sensitive (approximately 10%) in collecting fluorescence light. So for weak fluorescent samples, an objective without phase ring is better suited.\r\n    Check whether the selected cells are still in focus every half hour, until the experiment is running stably. When cells at this point are out of focus, adjust manually. Due to temperature variations, as well as poorly dried samples, this may be necessary during the first hours. Furthermore, due to enhanced contrast, the autofocus works better when more cells are in the field of view.\r\n\r\n    After the experiment has finished, separate the different channels of the movie and safe them as separate files (i.e. phase contrast, GFP, mCherry) if required (certain acquisition packages will place all channels in a single stacked file). For publication, pictures can be enhanced by 2D deconvolution, which is especially useful for protein localization studies. Deconvolve the images using your microscope's software or with a commercial package such as Huygens (www.svi.nl).\r\n    Analyze the data using ImageJ (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/) (use the raw, unprocessed image files for this) and Microsoft Excel or Sigma Plot. Stacks can for example be saved as an \".avi\" movie file in ImageJ. A detailed description of how fluorescence of single cells can be measured in time is given below.\r\n\r\n4. Data analysis of promoter activity dynamics using ImageJ\r\n\r\nWe note that other good software packages are available which are specialized in analyzing time-lapse microscopy images such as BHV software 9, 4, Schnitzcell 10, PSICIC 11, and Microbe-Tracker 12, but here we focus on the freely available ImageJ package.\r\n\r\n    Download ImageJ (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/) and (if necessary) the correct plugin to open your (stacked) file. For instance, movies recorded using a deltavision microscope can only be opened in ImageJ with the deltavision opener plugin. Copy the DV-plugin in the ImageJ plugin folder and start the program. Change the memory capacity in edit/option/memory&threads to 1250. This allows working with bigger files such as those obtained from time-lapse movies.\r\n    To assess the cell history of one single cell, open the original phase contrast movie of one microcolony and scroll to the last frame of interest in the movie. Select the \"segmented lines\" selection button in the menu.\r\n    Draw a line in the background and press \"CTRL\" + \"T\". This will open the regions of interest (ROI) manager. (The corresponding background fluorescence value can be used to manually substract the background - see below. Alternatively, use the background subtraction routine present within ImageJ.) Also draw a line in the cell of interest and add the ROI to the ROI manager. Since we are investigating promoter-GFP fusions in this case study and the GFP is diffused throughout the cytoplasm, the whole cell should have similar fluorescence values for each single pixel across the length of the cell. Scroll one frame back in time and select a new ROI in the same cell of interest. Save this third ROI and continue with the procedure until the corresponding ROI in the first frame of the movie has been saved.\r\n    Be aware that the fluorescence of daughter cells can vary greatly after cell division. Either use a membrane dye which can be applied together with fluorescence proteins produced by the cells (such as the combination of the red membrane dye FM® 5-95 (Invitrogen) and GFP) to visualize septum formation. In this case the corresponding fluorescence channel and not the phase contrast movie should be used to follow cells in time. Alternatively, one can stay on the safe side by selecting ROI's in only one half of a cell.\r\n    Within the ROI manager, click \"save\". If the ending of the file is \".roi\", then one roi is selected in the list, and only this one will be saved. If the ending of the file is \".zip\", then the whole set will be saved (required).\r\n    Close the phase contrast movie and open the original fluorescence movie (e.g. GFP). Click \"show all\" and \"measure\" in the ROI manager. A new window will open (Results). Copy the results into an Excel sheet and subtract the mean fluorescence for each single cell from the background fluorescence of the medium. The resulting net fluorescence can be plotted against the time to reveal the promoter activity of the cell of interest in time.\r\n    Alternatively, the fluorescence of all cells of a microcolony can be analyzed at a specific time-point. In order to do this select and save ROI's for the background and every single cell in one frame as described above, copy the fluorescence values to Excel and produce histograms using the \"histogram\" function in the \"tool\" menu.\r\n    To obtain pictures from single frames for publication, select the frame of interest, select \"image\" - \"duplicate image\" and change the type of image to \"RGB\" or \"8-bit\" by selecting \"image\" - \"type\" - \"RGB color\" or \"8-bit\". Save the duplicated frame as \".tiff\". The RGB/8-bit pictures can be opened by conventional drawing programs such as CorelDraw or Adobe Illustrator. If required, the pictures may be adapted using \"image\" - \"adjust\" - \"brightness/contrast\" or \"image\" - \"adjust\" - \"window/level\" in ImageJ.\r\n\r\n5. Producing movies for publication with ImageJ\r\n\r\n    Open the original phase contrast and the corresponding fluorescence movie(s) in ImageJ as described above. Select the rectangular selections button (1st on the left) and draw a rectangle ROI in the first frame in such a way, that the developing microcolony is enclosed by the ROI throughout the whole movie. Select \"image\" - \"crop\" and safe this smaller version of the movie under a new name. Select the same ROI via the ROI manager in the fluorescence movie and proceed as before.\r\n    To combine the movies either horizontally or vertically, select \"plugin\" - \"stack combiner\". If desired, a time stamper can be added via \"plugin\" - \"time stamper\". Save the combined stack once as \".dv\" or \".tiff\" and once as \".avi\" or quicktime movie.\r\n\r\nAlternative Protocol Adaptations for Streptococcus pneumoniae (Figure 4 and Movie 2):\r\n\r\n6. Preparation of S. pneumoniae cultures\r\n\r\n    Grow S. pneumoniae cells (capsulated strain D39 13, or unencapsulated strain R6 14 as standing cultures in C+Y medium 15 at 37°C until an OD at A600nm of approximately 0.4 is reached. Centrifuge the cells for 2 min at 14000 rpm and resuspend the cell pellet in a volume of fresh C+Y medium containing 14.5% glycerol (v/v) that would result in an A600nm of exactly 0.4. Aliquot the cells and store them at -80°C for future use.\r\n    For time-lapse microscopy, take an aliquot of previously cultured S. pneumoniae cells. Inoculate 4 ml of fresh C+Y medium 1:100 with cells from the -80°C aliquot. Grow the cells until mid-exponential phase to an OD of A600nm of 0.1 - 0.2. Usually, this takes about 2 hours when using cells from -80°C aliquots.\r\n\r\n7. Preparation of the microscope sample\r\n\r\n    Prepare a microscope slide as described above for B. subtilis but make sure that the agarose contains complex C+Y medium. Since S. pneumoniae is a microaerophile, the air pockets between agarose strips should be smaller than for B. subtilis (~1 mm space on both sides).\r\n    Measure the absorbance of the culture at 600 nm (A600), dilute the exponentially growing S. pneumoniae cells to an approximate A600 of 0.05 using C+Y medium and use this dilution to load the agarose slide.\r\n\r\n8. Time-lapse phase-contrast microscopy\r\n\r\nAdjust the microscope settings for S. pneumoniae: use phase-contrast microscopy since S. pneumoniae is difficult to identify using bright-field microscopy. Continue the protocol as described for B. subtilis (follow steps 2.9 - 3.7). S. pneumoniae cells can be grown at either 30°C or 37°C (they grow faster at 37°C).\r\n\r\n9. Representative results:\r\n\r\nThe time-lapse fluorescence experiment has been carried out successfully, if the bacteria grew into a microcolony monolayer, which is completely located within the field of view at the end of the experiment (see Figure 5A-C). If cells grew on top of each other, it is not only impossible to trace back their history accurately, but also the fluorescence levels of overlapping cells can not be measured correctly. Cells tend to grow on top of each other, if the spotted cells were not dried sufficiently (step 2.9) or if the medium composition needs to be adjusted to obtain slower growth. If a microcolony grew out of view, then the distribution of fluorescence signals within one colony can not be determined. Causes for \"microcolony movement\" can be insufficient drying of spotted cells (step 2.9), or if the software was not programmed to track the microcolony during development. Furthermore, it is important that local patches of increased fluorescence are not detectable in the medium as this obscures the fluorescence signals coming from the cells (see Figure 5D-F). Background related problems can arise from media compounds, airbubbles or undissolved agarose clumps. To visualize this, we show in Fig. 5F background signals of this specific slide when the image was taken using excitation/emission filters for red fluorescent dyes. As seen, bright autofluorescent spots are present which could hamper imaging. To prevent such spots, make sure the agarose is completely dissolved and there are no airbubbles when placing the coverslip on the microscope slide.\r\n\r\nDiscussion:\r\nIn contrast to many other single cell techniques, the time-lapse fluorescence microscopy method described here can be used to follow the history of a specific cell with regard to its ancestors, its behaviour, and division events. In combination with fluorescently labelled target promoters or proteins, specific developmental pathway activation can be followed in time and protein localization as well as protein dynamics can be monitored during bacterial development.\r\n\r\nAs indicated above, studies concentrating on different bacterial species can be performed by adapting the growth conditions according to the requirements for a specific bacterium. The only limitations we encountered are related to the growth conditions and sample size. Due to a sealed environment, medium conditions cannot be changed during the experiment. Furthermore, a maximum of four strains per experiment can be monitored efficiently.\r\n\r\nConsidering a few critical steps, the single cell analysis method described here can easily be applied using any automated microscope. In the following, an overview of these critical steps will be given. Detailed information can be found in the main text. General preparation: It is wise to check the autofocus settings required for a specific bacterium prior to the experiment. Likewise, approximate optimal settings for the visualization of fluorescence should be determined in advance, if possible. Furthermore, following a prepared time-line helps to have all material ready to use in time (pre-warming the microscope chamber, programming the microscope settings, preparing the slide one hour before the cells are in the desired growth phase, see Figure 1). Growth of B. subtilis in TLM and CDM: TLM and CDM are chemically defined starvation media in which B. subtilis only grows slowly. The time-period in which the cells are grown in the media might have to be prolonged depending on the specific strain. The slow growth prevents cells from piling up on each other. Preparation of the microscope sample: Air bubbles between the gene frame, the glass slide and the cover slip have to be prevented to prevent extensive drying of the agarose-based medium. The same holds for the medium/cover slip interface. It is crucial to let the cells dry enough, to prevent swimming and/or multiple layer growth. Time-lapse fluorescence microscopy: Pre-warming of the slide as well as the environmental chamber is crucial to prevent major autofocus problems. Cells should be selected in the middle of an agar pad, since these have the highest chance to stay in field and focus during the experiment (provided the sample was dried well enough). A maximum of 10 locations per experiments still works properly. After having selected the first cell of interest only use the software to adjust the focus (see text for details). Check whether the cells are still in focus during the first hours of the experiment in 30 min intervals. Analysis: It is important to check prior to extended analysis procedures whether the background of the medium has similar values in the fluorescence channels. Small dust particles, medium components, dirty lenses or tiny agarose clumps can contribute to locally increased fluorescence, making the movie difficult or impossible to analyse. Trouble shooting: If the cells grow on top of each other, this might either indicate that the coverslip was attached too soon or that the medium is not suited for growth of microcolony monolayers. If cells of interest continuously die prematurely, whereas other cells on the slide divide happily, you might want to check whether you put the UV-filter in position. It might also help to decrease the exposure time or light intensity during long experiments.\r\n\r\n\n\n\nINVESTIGATION\nWetlab approach to transcription fidelity\nORGANISMS\nStreptococcus pneumoniae\nPEOPLE\nJan-Willem Veening\nPROJECTS\nNoisy-Strep\nPUBLICATIONS\nSMC is recruited to oriC by ParB and promotes chromosome segregation in Streptococcus pneumoniae\nLive Cell Imaging of <em>Bacillus subtilis</em> and <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> using Automated Time-lapse Microscopy\nControl of cell division in Streptococcus pneumoniae by the conserved Ser/Thr protein kinase StkP\nSingle cell analysis of gene expression patterns during carbon starvation in Bacillus subtilis reveals large phenotypic variation\nSTUDY\nAutomated time-lapse microscopy\nSUBMITTER\nJan-Willem Veening\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nGeneration of cell material from Streptomyces coelicolor culture for metabolome analysis(id: 136 | type: sops)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nASSAYS\nOnline/offline measurements\nCREATORS\nPer Bruheim\nTrond Ellingsen\nSunniva Hoel\nØyvind Jakobsen\nHåvard Sletta\nAlexander Wentzel\nAnders Øverby\nINVESTIGATIONS\nMetabolism of Streptomyces coelicolor (SysMO STREAM)\nPEOPLE\nTrond Ellingsen\nØyvind Jakobsen\nJay Moore\nPer Bruheim\nHåvard Sletta\nAnders Øverby\nSunniva Hoel\nAlexander Wentzel\nPROJECTS\nSTREAM\nSTUDIES\nTimeseries 1\nSUBMITTER\nJay Moore\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nAnalysis of Escherichia coli mutants with a linear respiratory chain(id: 216 | type: publications)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nASSAYS\nDetermination of by-product formation and glucose uptake of mutants with linear respiratory chain at different aerobiosis levels\nDeternination of ArcA phosphroylation level in mutants with linear ETC at different defined aerobiosis levels\nDATA_FILES\nETCmutants_metabolites\nETC_mutants_ArcA\nPEOPLE\nKatja Bettenbrock\nStefan Stagge\nSonja Steinsiek\nPROJECTS\nSUMO\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nAlkali-metal-cation influx and efflux systems in nonconventional yeast species(id: 118 | type: publications)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nPEOPLE\nHana Sychrova\nJoaquin Ariño\nJose Ramos\nPROJECTS\nTRANSLUCENT\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nGene knock-ins at the LACZ/Y locus by recombineering in E.coli(id: 19 | type: sops)\n\nDescription: Generating gene knock-ins using MJF618 expressing the defective lambdoid prophage recombination system λ red.\n\n\nCREATORS\nLisbeth Lyngberg\nPEOPLE\nLisbeth Lyngberg\nPROJECTS\nKOSMOBAC\nSUBMITTER\nLisbeth Lyngberg\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nAnalysis of organic acids in the supernatant(id: 93 | type: sops)\n\nDescription: Method for analysis of various organic acids in the medium\n\n\nCREATORS\nMartijn Bekker\nPEOPLE\nMartijn Bekker\nPROJECTS\nSysMO-LAB\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nHeiko Lemcke(id: 1289 | type: people)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nINSTITUTIONS\nRostock University Medical Centre\nPROJECTS\niRhythmics\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nBiophysical analysis of putative interactions between TCA cycle enzymes of B. subtilis(id: 7 | type: presentations)\n\nDescription: Presentation given by Colin Harwood presenting results about ITC experiments to confirm interactions.

I am especially interested in the study of disease mechanisms and drug action mechanisms, drug repositioning and the definition of mechanism-based biomarkers by modeling complex cellular systems in which signaling, regulation and metabolism information are integrated (see an example with http://hipathia.babelomics.org/).\r\nThe scope of my research has evolved in parallel to the penetration of the “Big Data” concept in the life sciences. I have been working on genomic data integration and, specifically, during the last years, focusing on massive sequence data analysis. As an example of the impact of the developments of Dopazo’s group, the software GenomeMaps (www.genomemaps.org) has been chosen as the genome viewer of the International Cancer Genome Consortium data analysis portal (dcc.icgc.org). \r\nI have promoted and coordinated genomic projects such as the FutureClinic (www.futureclinic.es), to prepare the scenario for the introduction of the genome in the electronic health record, or the Medical Genome Project (www.medicalgenomeproject.com), to sequence 1000 patients of inherited diseases to search for new biomarkers and disease genes. I was also involved in international projects such as the MAQC and SEQC (best practices in the use of microarrays and NGS, respectively, for finding diagnostic biomarkers) or the START consortium to characterize the variability of the rat genome. I also coordinate the HPC4Genomics (http://www.hpc4g.org) consortium, a joint initiative of the CIPF, several universities and companies that aim to combine genomic, bioinformatic and computing skills to address the new challenges posed by the technological advancement in genomics.\r\n\n\n\nINSTITUTIONS\nCentro de Investigación Príncipe Felipe\nPROJECTS\nHUMET Startup\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nDetermination of (cytosolic) enzyme activities(id: 98 | type: sops)\n\nDescription: Sample preparation - SOP for sampling, preparation of cell-free extracts, and determination of total extracted protein\n\n\nCREATORS\nFemke Mensonides\nPEOPLE\nFemke Mensonides\nMaksim Zakhartsev\nPROJECTS\nMOSES\nSUBMITTER\nMaksim Zakhartsev\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nMathematical modelling of the agr operon in Staphylococcus aureus(id: 35 | type: publications)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nMODELS\nMathematical modelling of the agr operon in Staphylococcus aureus\nPEOPLE\nJohn King\nSara Jabbari\nPROJECTS\nCOSMIC\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCellular localization of choline-utilization proteins in Streptococcus pneumoniae using novel fluorescent reporter systems(id: 106 | type: publications)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nDATA_FILES\nRNA-seq wild type\nPEOPLE\nJan-Willem Veening\nPROJECTS\nNoisy-Strep\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nA Multiscale Computational Model of Human Galactose Metabolism(id: 170 | type: studies)\n\nDescription: Personalized liver function tests: A Multiscale Computational Model Predicts Individual Human Liver Function From Single-Cell Metabolism\r\n\r\nUnderstanding how liver function arises from the complex interaction of morphology, perfusion, and metabolism from single cells up to the entire organ requires systems-levels computational approaches. We report a multiscale mathematical model of the Human liver comprising the scales from single hepatocytes, over representation of ultra-structure and micro-circulation in the hepatic tissue, up to the entire organ integrated with perfusion. The model was validated against data on multiple spatial and temporal scales. Herein we describe the model construction and application to hepatic galactose metabolism demonstrating its utility via i) the personalization of liver function tests based on galactose elimination capacity (GEC), ii) the explanation of changes in liver function with aging, and iii) the prediction of population variability in liver function based on variability in liver volume and perfusion. We conclude that physiology- and morphology-based multiscale models can improve the evaluation of individual liver function. \r\n\r\nAvailability: Personalized prediction of liver function (GEC) was implemented in a proof-of-principle app available at https://www.livermetabolism.com/gec_app/.

However, D-xylose cannot be naturally utilised by several industrially relevant microorganisms. On the way to a strong bio-based economy in Europe, this widely available feedstock has to be made accessible for the sustainable microbial synthesis of value-added chemical building blocks to be used in a broad range of applications. The project aims at engineering Corynebacterium glutamicum and Saccharomyces cerevisiae to serve as flexible and carbon efficient microbial cell factories converting D-xylose derived from lignocellulosic material (LCM) into value added products covering diols, lactols and organic acids. Combination of genetic engineering and systems biology are used to demonstrate the potential of a rational system-level approach for metabolic engineering of C. glutamicum and S. cerevisiae. In particular, new fundamental knowledge is generated regarding the impact of industrial hydrolysates on the intracellular dynamics of proteins, metabolites and fluxes as well as global stress responses and production capabilities of the two platform organisms. Subsequently, model-driven optimization approaches are expected to show the feasibility of growth-decoupled production with the newly constructed producer strains on industrial hydrolysates. The project has a high potential for innovative industrial applications, and it is expected to contribute to improve the competitiveness of the European biotechnological industry.\n\n\nINSTITUTIONS\nForschungszentrum Jülich\nLund University\nDelft University of Technology (DUT)\nORGANISMS\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae\nCorynebacterium glutamicum\nPEOPLE\nSebastian Aljoscha Wahl\nStephan Noack\nGunnar Liden\nLisa Wasserstrom\nNiklas Tenhaef\nChristian Brüsseler\nCelina Tufvegren\nHenrik Almqvist\nJinrui Zhang\nJan Marienhagen\nMarie-Francoise Gorwa-Grauslund\nPROGRAMMES\nERASysAPP\nPUBLICATIONS\nFormation of xylitol and xylitol-5-phosphate and its impact on growth of d-xylose-utilizing Corynebacterium glutamicum strains\nEngineering of Corynebacterium glutamicum for minimized carbon loss during utilization of D-xylose containing substrates\nMiniaturized and automated adaptive laboratory evolution: Evolving Corynebacterium glutamicum towards an improved d-xylose utilization.\nCharacterization of the Weimberg Pathway in Caulobacter crescentus\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nTrygve Brautaset(id: 470 | type: people)\n\nDescription: Since 1st of January 2015 I am Professor in synthetic biology at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) institute of biotechnology.

An understanding of mechanisms that facilitate the physiological shift towards a proliferative metabolism in cancer cells is considered a major upcoming topic in oncology and is a key activity for future drug development. Due to the complexity of interrelations, a systems biology approach would be most suited. However, rarely a systems biology approach is taken that: (i) works at standard conditions, (ii) combines modelling and quantitative data generation on metabolism and signalling, (iii) considers primary healthy and cancerous cells, and (iv) addresses patient heterogeneity. This project covers all these aspects. It is therefore timely, highly innovative and demonstrates the potential of systems biology towards an application in oncology. \r\n\r\nKey questions:\r\nWhich isoforms of glycolytic enzymes and key signalling components are relevant in hepatocytes and hepatoma cells?\r\n\r\nHow does growth factor and inflammatory signalling affect glycolysis in hepatocytes and hepatoma cells?\r\n\r\nCan we design strategies for combinatorial interventions of metabolism and signal transduction to inhibit proliferation of cancer cells but not affecting healthy cells?\r\n\r\n\n\n\nINSTITUTIONS\nVU University Amsterdam\nChalmers University of Technology\nUniversity of Freiburg\nGerman Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)\nCharité University Medicine Berlin\nGriffin Discoveries BV\nUniversitätsklinikum Leipzig\nORGANISMS\nHomo sapiens\nPEOPLE\nBas Teusink\nJens Nielsen\nJurgen  Haanstra\nFrank Bruggerman\nUrsula Klingmüller\nDaniel Seehofer\nJens Timmer\nIwan De Esch\nMarkus Stepath\nAdil Mardinoglu\nAvlant Nilsson\nGeorg Damm\nJoep Vanlier\nMelanie Kiessig\nIrina Titkova\nMartin Böhm\nGerda Schicht\nPROGRAMMES\nERASysAPP\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nPDE model of oxygen diffusion near E. coli cells(id: 92 | type: models)\n\nDescription: This partial-differential equations model focuses on the oxygen gradients in consideration of the three-dimensional cell and environment.\n\n\nCREATORS\nSamantha Nolan\nPEOPLE\nDavid Knies\nSamantha Nolan\nPROJECTS\nSUMO\nSUBMITTER\nDavid Knies\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nPGK Kinetic characterisation(id: 198 | type: sops)\n\nDescription: SOP for measurement of PGK activity in extracts.\n\n\nASSAYS\nPGK\nCREATORS\nDawie Van Niekerk\nJacky Snoep\nINVESTIGATIONS\nGlucose metabolism in Plasmodium falciparum trophozoites\nPEOPLE\nJacky Snoep\nDawie Van Niekerk\nPROJECTS\nWhole body modelling of glucose metabolism in malaria patients\nSTUDIES\nModel construction\nSUBMITTER\nDawie Van Niekerk\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nAlkali metal cation transport and homeostasis in yeasts(id: 25 | type: publications)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nPEOPLE\nHana Sychrova\nJoaquin Ariño\nJose Ramos\nFalko Krause\nPROJECTS\nTRANSLUCENT\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nShinsuke Ohnuki(id: 545 | type: people)\n\nDescription: I am a postdoc in The University of Tokyo.

We have shown in previous work that differences in network dynamics are highly informative and provide a means to identify parts of the network that could be targeted to restore healthy function.\r\n\r\nThe work will be first carried out in 2D culture of human dermal fibroblasts then extended to a novel 3D in-vitro system which we have established and validation as a reliable surrogate for the human dermis. Intervention strategies will be explored in the computational model and subsequently tested in-vitro. The work will involve: generation of high throughput time series data; development and application of bioinformatics workflows to analyse the data and establish networks of molecular interactions governing the maintenance of ECM; building, calibration and validation of dynamic computational model(s) in vitro; use of the model(s) to identify intervention strategies to modify network behaviour; testing of molecules in-vitro that could be used in potential treatments to improve skin healthcare.\n\n\nINSTITUTIONS\nUniversity of Newcastle\nDurham University\nPEOPLE\nCiaran Welsh\nDaryl Shanley\nCraig Manning\nStefan Przyborski\nHannah O'Keefe\nJames Wordsworth\nPROGRAMMES\nNewcastle University Systems Modelling of Ageing\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nArabidopsis_clock_P2011 - PLM_64(id: 494 | type: studies)\n\nDescription: \tThis model is termed P2011 and derives from the article: <strong>The clock gene circuit in Arabidopsis includes a repressilator with additional feedback loops</strong><strong>. </strong>Alexandra Pokhilko, Aurora Piñas Fernández, Kieron D Edwards, Megan M Southern, Karen J Halliday &amp; Andrew J Millar <em>Mol.

Using a detailed kinetic model for the cellular reactions, we simulated the heterogeneity in the response of the individual cells, assuming small differences in a single internal parameter. By operating at two different flow rates per experiment, we observe four of categories of cell behaviour.

This spatial model is divided up into biological cells which are further divided into simulation boxes. The original model was designed to investigate how canal cells can accumulate auxin over time rather than to investigate the transport of auxin through the canal cells per se. The main outputs of the simulations in the original paper were the steady state ratios of auxin in the canal cell protoplasts to that in the parenchyma cell protoplasts for different cell sizes and AUX/LAX auxin carrier distributions.\tNote that the working version of the model is in the Simile (.sml) version rather than in XML (which is a temporary holding dummy file).&nbsp;\tThe publication is:\tKramer E.M.

Although rooted in the tradition of bacterial growth and intermediary metabolism, microbial physiology now embraces molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry, and indeed any discipline that can shed light on bacterial function. Much of our experimental work is conducted with Escherichia coli, the pre-eminent ‘model’ organism with unrivalled ease of genetic and physiological manipulation. We are also work on its close relation, Salmonella (an intracellular pathogen and cause of enteritis), Campylobacter jejuni (the most common cause of food-borne disease), as well as Mycobacterium and Neisseria species. Special foci at present are bacterial respiratory chains and haemoglobins, nitrosative stress tolerance in bacteria, the biochemistry of CO interactions and oxygen metabolism.\r\n\r\nThe approaches used to study these problems range from molecular genetics, through microbial biochemistry and biophysics, to physiology and the properties of microbial populations in vitro and in vivo. Consequently, the tools we use are diverse; they include manipulations in vitro and in vivo of nucleic acids, bacterial molecular genetics (e.g. microarray technology, transposon-mediated and site-directed mutagenesis, gene and operon fusions), protein purification, immunochemical methods and characterisation using optical (dual- and multi-wavelength spectrophotometry) tools.\r\n\n\n\nINSTITUTIONS\nUniversity of Sheffield\nPRESENTATIONS\nSystems Understanding of Microbial Oxygen- Dependent and Independent Catabolism (SUMO2 ): A coordinator’s overview\nPROJECTS\nSUMO\nPUBLICATIONS\nTranscript profiling and inference of Escherichia coli K-12 ArcA activity across the range of physiologically relevant oxygen concentrations\nSystems analysis of transcription factor activities in environments with stable and dynamic oxygen concentrations\nReprogramming of Escherichia coli K-12 metabolism during the initial phase of transition from an anaerobic to a micro-aerobic environment\nModelling complex biological systems using an agent-based approach\nTowards a Systems Level Understanding of the Oxygen Response of Escherichia coli\nA mathematical model of metabolism and regulation provides a systems-level view of how Escherichia coli responds to oxygen\nAgent-based modeling of oxygen-responsive transcription factors in Escherichia coli\nSOPS\nSimons method for making monolysogenic lacZ operon fusions on the E. coli chromosome\nQuantifying cytochromes\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nT2011 Ostreococcus clock, acc on - PLM_84, version 1, SIMPLIFIED(id: 510 | type: models)\n\nDescription: Simplified model file for PLaSMo accession ID PLM_84, version 1 (use simplified if your software cannot read the file, e.g. Sloppy Cell)\n\n\nASSAYS\nT2011 Ostreococcus clock, acc on - PLM_84, version 1\nCREATORS\nBioData SynthSys\nINVESTIGATIONS\nTroein, Carl\nPEOPLE\nBioData SynthSys\nPROJECTS\nPlaSMo model repository\nSTUDIES\nT2011 Ostreococcus clock, acc on - PLM_84\nSUBMITTER\nBioData SynthSys\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nSULFOSYSbiotech_Protein extraction_iTRAQ labeling_Peptides separation_mass spectrometry_data analysis(id: 210 | type: sops)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nCREATORS\nTheresa Kouril\nPEOPLE\nTheresa Kouril\nSUBMITTER\nTheresa Kouril\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nRecruitment and activation of a lipid kinase by hepatitis C virus NS5A is essential for integrity of the membranous replication compartment(id: 242 | type: publications)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nPEOPLE\nLars Kaderali\nMarco Binder\nRalf Bartenschlager\nPROJECTS\nSysVirDrug\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nSustained glycolytic oscillations in individual isolated yeast cells(id: 378 | type: studies)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nASSAYS\ngustavsson1-4 models\nCREATORS\nDawie Van Niekerk\nJacky Snoep\nINVESTIGATION\nGlycolytic oscillations in individual isolated yeast cells\nMODELS\ngustavsson1-4 models\nPEOPLE\nJacky Snoep\nDawie Van Niekerk\nPROJECTS\nYeast glycolytic oscillations\nPUBLICATIONS\nSustained glycolytic oscillations in individual isolated yeast cells\nSUBMITTER\nDawie Van Niekerk\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nMscL of Bacillus subtilis prevents selective release of cytoplasmic proteins in a hypotonic environment(id: 68 | type: publications)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nPEOPLE\nMichael Hecker\nUwe Voelker\nJan Maarten Van Dijl\nPROJECTS\nBaCell-SysMO\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nIn vitro phosphorylation of key metabolic enzymes from Bacillus subtilis: PrkC phosphorylates enzymes from different branches of basic metabolism(id: 69 | type: publications)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nPEOPLE\nJoerg Stuelke\nMichael Hecker\nUwe Voelker\nPROJECTS\nBaCell-SysMO\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nMark Musters(id: 52 | type: people)\n\nDescription: I'm a modeller, specialized in kinetic modeling of biochemical networks.

Unpack it in a directory and navigate with matlab to there. Use the 'matlab_execution_guide.m' for simulation and visualisation of the model. This file is written in matlab cell mode, so it is not a stand alone function.\r\n\r\nThree models have been developed to test their capacity to reproduce the experimental data from Study: 'Controlled sigmaB induction in shake flask' with Assay: 'IPTG induction of sigmaB in BSA115'.\r\nOne model assumes a post-transcriptional inhibition (PTI) in the expression of the lacZ reporter gene. The PTI is either due to induced instability of lacZ mRNA or LacZ protein after activation of sigmaB. A hypothetical sigmaB dependent protein RegB is responsible for PTI. It is either a RNase or protease in this model.\r\nOne model assumes a transcription inhibitory effect on sigmaB dependent expression by a sigmaB dependent protein called RegB. This protein might bind to the sigma factor to decrease its efficacy in inducing transcription.\r\nOne model assumes that a protease called RegB acts specifically on sigmaB. This protease is also induced by sigmaB.\r\nAll models is based on mass-action (nearly so). Parameter for IPTG concentration is [100,200,1000], kbs, the expression parameter of Pspac-dependent sigmaB is fixed at 100. All other six parameters are estimated with two of the three experiments as training set (IPTG 0.1 and 0.2 mM) and one experiment as test set (IPTG 1mM). Parameter estimation is performed with SBToolbox2 using multiple rounds of particle swarm algorithm (pswarm).\r\n\n\n\nASSAYS\nIPTG induction of sigmaB in BSA115\nCREATORS\nUlf Liebal\nINVESTIGATIONS\nThe transition from growing to non-growing Bacillus subtilis cells\nPEOPLE\nUlf Liebal\nPROJECTS\nBaCell-SysMO\nPUBLICATIONS\nProteolysis of beta-galactosidase following SigmaB activation in Bacillus subtilis\nSTUDIES\nControlled sigmaB induction in shake flask\nSUBMITTER\nUlf Liebal\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nZucAt: multi-compartment metabolic model of growing Arabidopsis thaliana(id: 186 | type: models)\n\nDescription: The model presents a multi-compartmental (mesophyll, phloem and root) metabolic model of growing Arabidopsis thaliana. The flux balance analysis (FBA) of the model quantifies: sugar metabolism, central carbon and nitrogen metabolism, energy and redox metabolism, proton turnover, sucrose translocation from mesophyll to root and biomass growth under both dark- and light-growth conditions with corresponding growth either on starch (in darkness) or on CO2 (under light). The FBA predicts that photosynthetically active plastid [under fixed ratio of photorespiration / photosynthesis = 0.2] can operate in different energy modes by levering the cyclic electron flow through FQR reaction in light photosynthesis system: (i) when flux through FQR = 0, the plastid is forced to import ATP from cytosol to fulfil the ATP/NADPH requirement for carbon fixation; (ii) when the flux through FQR equals to 0.35 of non-cyclic photosynthesis, the plastid becomes self-sufficient in terms of the ATP balance; (iii) when the flux through FQR is >0.35 of non-cyclic photosynthesis, then the plastid produces ATP surplus, which is exported to cytosol. Thus, the interplay between cyclic photophosphorylation and photorespiration can play regulatory role in adapting of the energy state of plastid to various conditions to hold ATP/NADPH ratio sufficient for the carbon fixation in Calvin cycle. Under all tested “light” scenarios, NADPH is over-produced in light photosynthesis system, and therefore its surplus is exported from plastid through malate/oxaloacetate shuttle into mitochondria, where the reduced equivalents are used for ATP synthesis. From the energetic point of view, mitochondria is the main ATP provider for cytoplasmic processes together with plastid (when it is actual), glycolysis under both light- and dark-growth conditions; also, mitochondria is the main sink for reduced equivalents translocated both from plastid and from cytoplasm.\r\nThe model described all main metabolic processes participating in the proton metabolism. The translocation of sucrose among plant tissues was associated with an integral balance of protons, which in turn was partially defined by operational modes of the energy metabolism (photosynthesis, respiration). The proton fluxes predicted by FBA generally corresponds to the molecular mechanisms and functional peculiarity of the sucrose transporters SWEET and SUC/STP proton-symporters and net-flux of sucrose from ‘source’ to ‘sink’ tissue. Thus, our multi-compartmental model adequately describes the growth stoichiometry and quantifies sucrose translocation processes of Arabidopsis thaliana in light and dark conditions.\n\n\nASSAYS\nFlux Balance Analysis of multi-compartment metabolic model of growing Arabidopsis thaliana\nCREATORS\nMaksim Zakhartsev\nOlga Krebs\nIrina Medvedeva\nIlya Akberdin\nYuriy  Orlov\nINVESTIGATIONS\nMetabolic analysis of effects of sucrose translocation on phenotypic traits of Arabidopsis thaliana\nPEOPLE\nMaksim Zakhartsev\nOlga Krebs\nYuriy  Orlov\nIlya Akberdin\nIrina Medvedeva\nPROJECTS\nZucAt\nPUBLICATIONS\nMetabolic model of central carbon and energy metabolisms of growing Arabidopsis thaliana in relation to sucrose translocation\nSTUDIES\nAnalysis of central carbon and energy metabolisms of growing Arabidopsis thaliana in relation to sucrose translocation\nSUBMITTER\nMaksim Zakhartsev\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nKey Cell-Physiological Parameters(id: 30 | type: studies)\n\nDescription: How does the Volume, internal pH, membrane potential and intracellular cation content change in a time dependent scale during potassium limitation. \n\n\nASSAYS\nVolume determination during starvation at different times.\nTime courses of the internal pH changes\nHow does internal potassium change (/decrease) during several hours of potassium starvation.\nHow starvation affect protein content in yeast cells\nExternal Potassium Concentration\nExternal pH changes\nProtein Concentration\nMembrane Potential\nINVESTIGATION\nK+ Starvation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae\nPEOPLE\nFalko Krause\nPROJECTS\nTRANSLUCENT\nSUBMITTER\nFalko Krause\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nTranscriptome data of Clostridium acetobutylicum growing at steady-state pH 5.7 and pH 4.5.(id: 833 | type: data_files)\n\nDescription: Micro array analysis of steady-state growing cells of Clostridium acetobutylicum at pH 5.7 (acidogenesis) in comparison to pH 4.5 (solventogenesis).\n\n\nASSAYS\nComparison of the transcriptome between pH 5.7 (acidogenesis) and pH 4.5 (solventogenesis)\nCREATORS\nHolger Janssen\nINVESTIGATIONS\nThe effect of pH upon the metabolic shift in Clostridium acetobutylicum in continuous culture.\nPEOPLE\nHolger Janssen\nPROJECTS\nCOSMIC\nPUBLICATIONS\nIntegrative modelling of pH-dependent enzyme activity and transcriptomic regulation of the acetone-butanol-ethanol fermentation of\n              Clostridium acetobutylicum\n              in continuous culture\nSTUDIES\nEffect of pH upon the transcriptome\nSUBMITTER\nHolger Janssen\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nIan Booth(id: 40 | type: people)\n\nDescription: My research interests are in the physiology of bacteria subjected to stress.

Production of proteins is the most resource exhaustive process for the cells and therefore needs to be optimized to achieve maximal productivities. Natural environment of E. coli is much harsher compared to the near optimal growth conditions used in production processes. In order to survive cells produce many native proteins that could be considered unnecessary for the cells in industrial production conditions. In this project we aim to remove the most resource exhaustive unnecessary proteins from the host cells to free up resources for recombinant protein production. We will focus on this by using a novel metabolic modeling approach with constraints of protein production and cell geometry together with proteomics-based host cell physiology characterization. Novel lean-proteome strains with removed unnecessary proteins will be tested for the improved production capacity of several recombinant proteins used in research, industry and diagnostics.\n\n\nINSTITUTIONS\nNorwegian University of Science and Technology\nTechnische Universität Berlin (TU Berlin)\nLatvia University of Agriculture\nCompetence Center of Food and Fermentation Technologies\nbiotechrabbit GmbH\nORGANISMS\nEscherichia coli\nPEOPLE\nTrygve Brautaset\nKlaus Bensch\nRaivo Vilu\nEgils Stalidzans\nPeter Neubauer\nKarl Peebo\nAgris Pentjuss\nSebastian Hans\nAgnieszka Gawin\nPROGRAMMES\nERASysAPP\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nAbsolute intracellular concentrations of metabolites extracted from T. b. brucei 427 wild type(id: 926 | type: data_files)\n\nDescription: Intracellular concentrations of 50 metabolites measured by LC-MS using isotope ratio based mass spectrometry technique\n\n\nASSAYS\nLC-MS based absolute quantification of intracellular metabolites\nCREATORS\nDong-Hyun Kim\nINVESTIGATIONS\nMetabolite profiling, quantification and flux quantification\nPEOPLE\nDong-Hyun Kim\nPROJECTS\nSilicoTryp\nSTUDIES\nMetabolic flux measurement\nSUBMITTER\nDong-Hyun Kim\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nSemanticSBML: a tool for annotating, checking, and merging of biochemical models in SBML format(id: 30 | type: publications)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nPEOPLE\nEdda Klipp\nFalko Krause\nPROJECTS\nTRANSLUCENT\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nDefining the robust behaviour of the plant clock gene circuit with absolute RNA timeseries and open infrastructure(id: 306 | type: publications)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nMODELS\nArabidopsis clock model P2011.1.2\nP2011.1.2_directupload\nPEOPLE\nAndrew Millar\nPROJECTS\nMillar group\nSTUDIES\nArabidopsis clock models P2011.1.2 and P2011.2.1 - PLM_71\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nTranscription of glucose uptake transport systems in a mutant background under anaerobic conditions.(id: 1072 | type: data_files)\n\nDescription: Transcription of glucose uptake transport systems in a mutant background under anaerobic batch conditions.\n\n\nASSAYS\nAerobic and anaerobic characterization of MG1655 and mutant strains with regard to transcription profiles.\nCREATORS\nSonja Steinsiek\nINVESTIGATIONS\nAnalysis of the glucose transport in Escherichia coli under aerobic and anaerobic conditions\nPEOPLE\nSonja Steinsiek\nPROJECTS\nSUMO\nPUBLICATIONS\nGlucose Transport in Escherichia coli Mutant Strains with Defects in Sugar Transport Systems\nSTUDIES\nCharacterization of mutant strains with defects in sugar transport systems\nSUBMITTER\nSonja Steinsiek\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nFigure 3A: Model calibration with experimental data of JAK2-STAT5 signaling obtained by different experimental techniques.(id: 148 | type: studies)\n\nDescription: For all experiments, primary CFU-E cells were starved and stimulated with 5 U/ml Epo.

FLAME environmet has beem used for agent-based development. The FLAME framework is an enabling tool to create agent-based models that can be run on high performance computers (HPCs).  Models are created based upon extended finite state machines that include message input and output. This information is used by the frame work to automatically generate a simulation program that can run models  efficiently on HPCs.\r\nIn order to develop agent-based model in FLAME, the user need to define at least three xml  files as described below:\r\n\r\nModel.xml : X-Machine Agent Markup Modelling Language (XMML)\r\nA  description language for agent-based simulations. XMML should contain the whole structure of the  model\r\ni.e Agent descriptions, memory variables, functions, messages\r\n\r\nFunctions.c – should contain the implementations of the functions specified in Model.xml \r\n\r\n0.xml – should contain the initial states of the memory variables of the agents \r\ni.e Initializations of all parameters\r\n\r\nThe number of the resulting XML files depends on the number of iterations you specify to run your model (through Main.exe).\r\n\r\nEach important molecule is specified in the XMML language and information about its location (abstract co-ordinates), its state, its ability to interact with other molecules and the conditions under which this happens are encoded in its definition. \r\n\n\n\nCREATORS\nAfsaneh Maleki-Dizaji\nPEOPLE\nAfsaneh Maleki-Dizaji\nPROJECTS\nSUMO\nSUBMITTER\nAfsaneh Maleki-Dizaji\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nSalazar2009_FloweringPhotoperiod - PLM_9, version 2, SIMPLIFIED(id: 502 | type: models)\n\nDescription: Simplified model file for PLaSMo accession ID PLM_9, version 2 (use simplified if your software cannot read the file, e.g. Sloppy Cell)\n\n\nASSAYS\nSalazar2009_FloweringPhotoperiod - PLM_9, version 2\nCREATORS\nBioData SynthSys\nAndrew Millar\nINVESTIGATIONS\nMillar, Andrew\nPEOPLE\nAndrew Millar\nBioData SynthSys\nPROJECTS\nPlaSMo model repository\nSTUDIES\nSalazar2009_FloweringPhotoperiod - PLM_9\nSUBMITTER\nBioData SynthSys\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nGene position within a long transcript as a determinant for stochastic switching in bacteria(id: 103 | type: publications)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nDATA_FILES\nRNA-seq wild type\nPEOPLE\nOscar Kuipers\nJan-Willem Veening\nPROJECTS\nNoisy-Strep\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nTranscript profiling and inference of Escherichia coli K-12 ArcA activity across the range of physiologically relevant oxygen concentrations(id: 100 | type: publications)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nASSAYS\nArcA phosphorylation at different aerobiosis levels (steady states)\nDATA_FILES\nSteady state transcriptional profiles at different oxygen concentrations\nMODELS\nTFInfer: a tool for probabilistic inference of transcription factor activities\nPEOPLE\nJeff Green\nJoost Teixeira De Mattos\nRobert Poole\nAlison Graham\nMatthew Rolfe\nAlexander Ter Beek\nPROJECTS\nSUMO\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nGenetic or chemical protease inhibition causes significant changes in the Bacillus subtilis exoproteome(id: 63 | type: publications)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nPEOPLE\nMichael Hecker\nUwe Voelker\nJan Maarten Van Dijl\nPROJECTS\nBaCell-SysMO\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nSource data for Figure 3A: Experimental quantitative immunoblotting data.(id: 1329 | type: data_files)\n\nDescription: See 'Figure 3 legend' and 'Materials and methods - Time course experiments, cell lysis and quantitative immunoblotting' for details.\n\n\nASSAYS\nSource data for Figure 3A: Experimental quantitative immunoblotting data.\nCREATORS\nDawie Van Niekerk\nJacky Snoep\nINVESTIGATIONS\nBachmann et al (2011) Molecular Systems Biology 7:516\nPEOPLE\nJacky Snoep\nDawie Van Niekerk\nPROJECTS\nMolecular Systems Biology\nSTUDIES\nFigure 3A: Model calibration with experimental data of JAK2-STAT5 signaling obtained by different experimental techniques.\nSUBMITTER\nDawie Van Niekerk\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nSustained glycolytic oscillations in individual isolated yeast cells - I(id: 84 | type: models)\n\nDescription: Using optical tweezers to position yeast cells in a microfluidic chamber, we were able to observe sustained oscillations in individual isolated cells.

The enzymes isolated from these species and from other extreme habitats are more robust to temperature, organic solvents and proteolysis. They often have unique substrate specificities and originate from novel metabolic pathways. Thermophiles as well as their stable enzymes (‘thermozymes’) are receiving increased attention for biotechnological applications.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will establish thermophilic in vitro enzyme cascades as well as two new chassis, the thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus (Tth, 65-75°C, pH 7.0) and the thermoacidophilic archaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius (Saci, 75-80°C, pH 2-4), as new thermophilic, bacterial and archaeal platforms for the production of novel high added-value products, i.e. ‘extremolytes’. Extremolytes are small molecular compatible solutes found naturally in the cells of thermophilic species that accumulate in the cell in response to multiple environmental stresses and stabilize cellular components (including proteins, membranes). Extremolytes offer an amazing so far unexploited potential for industrial applications including food, health, consumer care and cosmetics. However, their production in common mesophilic organisms (i.e. yeast, E. coli) is currently hampered by the hyperthermophilic origin of the respective metabolic pathways requiring a thermophilic cell factory.\n\n\nINSTITUTIONS\nUniversity Duisburg-Essen\nUniversity of Stellenbosch\nUniversitity Duisburg-Essen\nWinogradsky Institute of Microbiology, Federal Research Center “Biotechnology\", Russian Academy of Sciences\nUniversity of Exeter\nEvonik Industries AG\nORGANISMS\nThermus thermophilus\nSulfolobus acidocaldarius\nEscherichia coli\nPEOPLE\nJacky Snoep\nBettina Siebers\nIlya Kublanov\nSimone Antonio De Rose\nSergey Gavrilov\nJennifer Littlechild\nChristina Stracke\nNicholas Harmer\nBenjamin Meyer\nFelix Mueller\nPROGRAMMES\nEra CoBioTech\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nWetlab approach to transcription fidelity(id: 26 | type: investigations)\n\nDescription: Handling and manipulation of S. pneumoniae using molecular, cell biological and genetic tools.\n\n\nASSAYS\nParB-GFP ChIP on chip\nKinetics of misincorporation and proofreading by bacterial RNA polymerase\nRNA-Seq\nLive Cell Imaging of Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus pneumoniae using Automated Time-lapse Microscopy.\nDATA_FILES\nChIP-chip ParB-GFP\nRNA-seq wild type\nRNA-seq delta greA\nPEOPLE\nJan-Willem Veening\nPROJECTS\nNoisy-Strep\nPUBLICATIONS\nSMC is recruited to oriC by ParB and promotes chromosome segregation in Streptococcus pneumoniae\nLive Cell Imaging of <em>Bacillus subtilis</em> and <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> using Automated Time-lapse Microscopy\nControl of cell division in Streptococcus pneumoniae by the conserved Ser/Thr protein kinase StkP\nSingle cell analysis of gene expression patterns during carbon starvation in Bacillus subtilis reveals large phenotypic variation\nControl of transcription elongation by GreA determines rate of gene expression in Streptococcus pneumoniae\nSTUDIES\nChromosome segregation in S. pneumoniae\nInvestigation of bacterial transcription fidelity and processivity\nThe role of transcription factor GreA in transcription fidelity and processivity in Streptococcus pneumoniae\nAutomated time-lapse microscopy\nSUBMITTER\nJan-Willem Veening\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nT2011 Ostreococcus clock, TOC1 act D - PLM_92, version 1, SIMPLIFIED(id: 520 | type: models)\n\nDescription: Simplified model file for PLaSMo accession ID PLM_92, version 1 (use simplified if your software cannot read the file, e.g. Sloppy Cell)\n\n\nASSAYS\nT2011 Ostreococcus clock, TOC1 act D - PLM_92, version 1\nCREATORS\nBioData SynthSys\nINVESTIGATIONS\nTroein, Carl\nPEOPLE\nBioData SynthSys\nPROJECTS\nPlaSMo model repository\nSTUDIES\nT2011 Ostreococcus clock, TOC1 act D - PLM_92\nSUBMITTER\nBioData SynthSys\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nALD Kinetic characterisation(id: 195 | type: sops)\n\nDescription: SOP for measurement of ALD activity in extracts.\n\n\nASSAYS\nALD\nCREATORS\nDawie Van Niekerk\nJacky Snoep\nINVESTIGATIONS\nGlucose metabolism in Plasmodium falciparum trophozoites\nPEOPLE\nJacky Snoep\nDawie Van Niekerk\nPROJECTS\nWhole body modelling of glucose metabolism in malaria patients\nSTUDIES\nModel construction\nSUBMITTER\nDawie Van Niekerk\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nSpontaneous spatiotemporal waves of gene expression from biological clocks in the leaf(id: 325 | type: publications)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nPEOPLE\nAndrew Millar\nPROJECTS\nMillar group\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nAuxSim - PLM_27, version 1(id: 851 | type: assays)\n\nDescription: \tA cell-level model of the Arabidopsis root elongation zone. This spatial model is divided up into biological cells which are further divided into simulation boxes. The original model was designed to investigate how canal cells can accumulate auxin over time rather than to investigate the transport of auxin through the canal cells per se. The main outputs of the simulations in the original paper were the steady state ratios of auxin in the canal cell protoplasts to that in the parenchyma cell protoplasts for different cell sizes and AUX/LAX auxin carrier distributions.\tNote that the working version of the model is in the Simile (.sml) version rather than in XML (which is a temporary holding dummy file).&nbsp;\tThe publication is:\tKramer E.M.

The growth of S. solfataricus on ‘alternative’ carbon sources (e.g. polymers, pentoses, sugar acids, aldehydes) will be analysed to elucidate the respective degradation pathways and to identify the involved enzymes; using this functional systems biology approach we expect to identify new enzymes of industrial interest. In collaboration with the industrial project partners target enzymes will be selected and screened for their potential for application (e.g. production efficiency). The initial focus will be on enzymes involved in the production of stereospecific base and fine chemicals and biomass conversion. The increasing knowledge of archaeal metabolic networks with respect to cellular blueprints, their complexity and regulation will be a major resource for a continuous stream of new applications.\r\n\n\n\nASSAYS\nRNA sequencing:l-fuc/d-glu\nintracellular metabolome analysis: l-fucose vs d-glucose\nProteome analysis: d-fuc / l-glu\nCell free extract activity measurements: L-fuc/d-glc\nMetabolic model of Sulfolobus solfataricus\nRNA sequencing: Casaminoacids vs D-glc\nProteome analysis: Casaminoacids versus D-Glc\nMetabolome analysis: Casaminoacids versus D-Glc\nMetabolic modelling of S. solfataricus during growth on casaminoacids\nnon-enzymatic phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) degradation at high temperature\nPGK 30C data\nPGK 30C model\nPGK 70 data\nBPG degradation\nPGK-GAPDH 30\nPGK-GAPDH 70\nBPG stability analysis\nPGK 70C model\nPGK - GAPDH models\nDATA_FILES\nTranscriptomics L-fuc vs D-glc\nActivity assay L-fuc vs D-glc\nMetabolomics L-fuc vs D-glc\nProteomics L-fuc vs D-glc\nSSO Genome reference\nRNA-Seq raw data - Sulfolobus solfataricus P2 - casaminoacids and d-glucose\nRNA-Seq mappings - Sulfolobus solfataricus P2 - casaminoacids\nRNA-Seq mappings - Sulfolobus solfataricus P2 - d-glucose\nMetabolomics Casaminoacids vs Glc\nCalculation of amino acid uptake rates\nProteomics_Casaminoacids vs Glucose_Phenyx search output\nProteomics_Casaminoacids vs Glucose_results\nRaw MS data Casaminoacids vs glucose  - Main Zip archive\nRaw MS data Casaminoacids vs glucose - Supplementary file 1\nRaw MS data Casaminoacids vs Glucose - Supplementary file 2\nRaw MS data Casaminoacids vs Glucose - Supplementary file 3\nBiomass composition of S. solfataricus P2 grown on caseinhydrolysate\nDescription of changes made to the model compared to the first publication in 2012\nAmino acid depletion profile of S. solfataricus during growth on 1 % casaminoacids\nDistribution of enzymes involved in oxidative Stickland reactions among archaea\nnon-enzymatic phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) degradation at 70°C and 80°C\nIntegrated summary of transcriptomics and proteomics results\nPGK yeast with recycling of ATP\nPGK yeast without recycling of ATP\nINSTITUTIONS\nVU University Amsterdam\nUniversity of Braunschweig\nUniversity Duisburg-Essen\nManchester Centre for Integrative Systems Biology, University of Manchester\nUniversity of Sheffield\nUniversity of Stellenbosch\nMax-Planck-Institute for terrestrial Microbiology\nOtto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg\nUniversity Bielefeld\nSigma Aldrich ( Swiss)\nOtto-von-Guericke-Universität Magdeburg\nINVESTIGATIONS\nL-fucose degradation in Sulfolobus solfataricus P2\nAmino acid degradation in Sulfolobus solfataricus P2\nPhosphoglycerate kinase acts as a futile cycle at high temperature\nMODELS\nMetabolic model of Sulfolobus solfataricus\nMetabolic model of Sulfolobus solfataricus\nPGK yeast with/without recycling\nPGK yeast Fig1a\nBPG stability notebook\nPGK 70C model Fig. 3\nPGK 70C SBML\nPGK-GAPDH models yeast and Sulfolobus Fig. 4\nPGK-GAPDH model yeast kouril7\nPGK-GAPDH model Sulfolobus kouril8\nORGANISMS\nSulfolobus solfataricus\nPEOPLE\nJacky Snoep\nDietmar Schomburg\nHans Westerhoff\nBettina Siebers\nPhil Wright\nSonja-Verena Albers\nKerstin Schreiber\nTheresa Kouril\nTrong Khoa Pham\nStefan Albaum\nKatharina Kruse\nHelge Stark\nIda Schomburg\nJacqueline Wolf\nJörg Schaber\nRoland Wohlgemuth\nTobias Jakobi\nAntje Chang\nClaus-Rüdiger Wallis\nAndreas Albersmeier\nSofia Figueiredo\nPROGRAMMES\ne:Bio\nPUBLICATIONS\nA systems biology approach reveals major metabolic changes in the thermoacidophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus in response to the carbon source L-fucose versus D-glucose\nOxidative Stickland reactions in an obligate aerobic organism - amino acid catabolism in the Crenarchaeon\n              Sulfolobus solfataricus\nSystems biology of the modified branched Entner-Doudoroff pathway in Sulfolobus solfataricus.\nPhosphoglycerate kinase acts as a futile cycle at high temperature.\nSOPS\nSulfoSYS_BIOTECH: RNA isolation and sequencing\nSULFOSYSbiotech_Proteome analysis\nSTUDIES\nComparison of S. solfataricus grown on l-fucose and d-glucose\nComparison of Sulfolobus solfataricus P2 grown on caseinhydrolysate and D-glucose\nPGK-30C\nPGK-70C\nBPG stability\nPGK-GAPDH 30C & 70C\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nAre microRNAs key mediators of cartilage destruction in osteoarthritis?(id: 119 | type: projects)\n\nDescription: MicroRNAs are a recently discovered group of factors that control cell behaviour. There are thousands of microRNAs, but specific ones control the behaviour of cartilage cells and have key roles in osteoarthritis. Changing the level of a single microRNA can alter osteoarthritis, but we know that several microRNAs change during disease. The group has identified four microRNAs which have key roles in cartilage. This programme seeks:\r\n\r\nto show that these microRNAs have a role in osteoarthritis in the whole animal (not just the laboratory);\r\nto find the optimum way to deliver a microRNA to the joint to act as a therapy\r\nand to build a computer model of microRNA action in osteoarthritis to identify the outcomes of changing specific microRNAs therapeutically.\r\nThe programme of work aims to move the research towards clinical utility.\n\n\nINSTITUTIONS\nUniversity of Newcastle\nPEOPLE\nDaryl Shanley\nKrutik Patel\nPROGRAMMES\nNewcastle University Systems Modelling of Ageing\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nFunctional analysis of the sortase YhcS in Bacillus subtilis(id: 154 | type: publications)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nPEOPLE\nMichael Hecker\nLeif Steil\nJan Maarten Van Dijl\nPROJECTS\nBaCell-SysMO\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\n2D-Gel Electrophoresis(id: 70 | type: assays)\n\nDescription: Is it possible to see changes in the proteome after starvation in 2D- Gels?

Primary metabolism is growth related and involves all the normal cellular activities associated with cell growth and division. Whereas secondary metabolism is non-growth linked and is non-essential but many important activities occur during this phase which help the bacterium survive.\r\n\r\nOne of these activities is antibiotic production and is widespread in streptomycetes found in most soils. These bacteria have a fascinating life history and are abundant producers of biologically active compounds many of which have been exploited for their anti-tumour, anti-bacteria and anti-fungal activity.\r\n\r\nOur research will improve our understanding of how these bacteria regulate the transitions from primary to secondary metabolism and provide mathematical models to simulate the metabolic switch of life styles.\r\n\r\nThe approach is regarded as a ‘systems’ analysis where a model is built of the whole metabolism and it can predict outcomes that will not have been determined previously by experimental methods. A range of modelling tools will be provided and these will be available for use with many other projects involved in a systems approach. The fuller understanding of the metabolic switch and the elucidation of how and why certain antibiotics are made under defined growth conditions will be vital for the exploitation of these bacteria. Many tools are available to manipulate bacterial genomes and with an understanding of the metabolism it will be possible to manipulate growth in order to produce novel antibiotics.\n\n\nASSAYS\nOnline/offline measurements\ntranscriptomics\nmetabolomics\nproteomics\nMetabolic pathway curation\nCREATORS\nAlexander Wentzel\nM.

Transcriptional noise is a main determinant that causes switching between different states in bistable systems. By using the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae as a model bacterium, we will investigate how transcriptional fidelity and processivity influence (noisy) gene expression and participate in bistability. To study this question, we will use both natural and synthetic S. pneumoniae bistable switches as a highly sensitive probe for transcriptional noise. We will screen for mutations of the transcriptional apparatus that display altered bistability. A pure in vitro transcription system for S. pneumoniae will be set up and used to quantitatively characterize effects of these mutations on transcription. Detailed single-cell analysis using time-lapse microscopy will yield quantifiable data on the effects of the mutations on switching times and probabilities. Mathematical models that take transcription fidelity and processivity into account will be used to pinpoint parameters which most strongly affect the switching probabilities of our bistable networks. A global model encompassing all our in vivo and in vitro data will yield a high resolution systems-level understanding of the role of transcriptional noise in gene regulation of a human pathogen. Genetic and biochemical characterization of mutant RNAPs and/or accessory factors will yield molecular insights into the fundamental mechanisms of transcription. Furthermore, our results might lead to novel drug discovery projects specifically aimed to reduce or increase transcriptional noise to prevent unwanted development of pathogenic bacteria such as S. pneumoniae\n\n\nASSAYS\nParB-GFP ChIP on chip\nKinetics of misincorporation and proofreading by bacterial RNA polymerase\nRNA-Seq\nLive Cell Imaging of Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus pneumoniae

By connecting fields such as genomics, proteomics, bioinformatics, mathematics, cell biology, genetics, mathematics, engineering and computer sciences, Systems Biology enables discovery of yet unknown principles underlying the functioning of living cells. At the same time, testable and predictive models of complex cellular pathways and eventually of whole cells and organisms are generated as tools for research. ICYSB will provide a hands-on experience in integrating experimentation and mathematical modelling with an emphasis on kinetic modelling of cellular pathways. The course focuses on yeast because the development of the emerging field of Systems Biology requires suitable model systems for data generation.\n\n\nDATA_FILES\nList of Participants\nINSTITUTIONS\nHeidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies (HITS gGmbH)\nImperial College London\nHumboldt-Universität zu Berlin\nVU University Amsterdam\nUniversity of Goettingen\nManchester Centre for Integrative Systems Biology, University of Manchester\nUniversity of Newcastle\nSchool of Computer Science, University of Manchester\nOtto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg\nETH Zurich\nUniversity of Luxembourg\nUniversity of Gothenburg\nUniversität Konstanz\nOkayama University\nBuenos Aires\nUniversity of Milano-Bicocca\nUniversity of Tübingen\nUni Basel\nÅbo Akademi University\nInstitute of Cytology and Genetics\nInstitute for Experimental Internal Medicine\nInstitute for Biomechanics\nUniversity of Tokyo\nMax-Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics\nInstitut Curie\nStockholm University\nRadboud University Nijmegen\nInstitute of Pathology\nIFIBYNE - Physiology, Molecular Biology  and Neurosciences\nMODELS\niNS142 RobOKoD Redesigned Butanol Producing.\nORGANISMS\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae\nPEOPLE\nStuart Owen\nOlga Krebs\nWolfgang Müller\nQuyen Nguyen\nNatalie Stanford\nJörg Schaber\nRostyslav Kuzyakiv\nICYSB  Participant\nAnnika Hantusch\nKoji Ishikawa\nEszter Lakatos\nCecilia Brännmark\nPaula Dunayevich\nAstrid Wachter\nRaffaele Nicastro\nPhillipp Schmidt\nThomas Hentrich\nArnaud Monnard\nCarolyn Alia Joko\nAlexandra Klimenko\nCiaran Welsh\nAnastasiya Lapytsko\nShinsuke Ohnuki\nScott Lovell\nSeverin Ehret\nBarbara Mlody\nKathiresan Natarajan\nDaniel Morgan\nMaaruthy Yelleswarapu\nSimone Keller\nYuan Qixia\nALEJANDRO  COLMAN-LERNER\nMarija  Cvijovic\nMarcus Krantz\nStefan Hohmann\nAriane Scheuren\nNiek Welkenhuysen\nPROGRAMMES\nIndependent Projects\nPUBLICATIONS\nModelling reveals novel roles of two parallel signalling pathways and homeostatic feedbacks in yeast\nNested autoinhibitory feedbacks alter the resistance of homeostatic adaptive biochemical networks\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\n091016 quinones complete data magdeburg(id: 65 | type: data_files)\n\nDescription: his document contains data for quinone concentrations and ratios of ubichinon and menachinon.These data have been generated for analysis of MG1655 at steady-state conditions in Infors-Multifors-Bioreactors.

In this solution, (i) the ratio photorespiration / photosynthesis has been fixed to 0.25; and (ii) cyclic electron flow through FQR (ferredoxin-plastoquinone reductase) has been set 0.1 from non-cyclic flow through FRN (ferredoxin-NADP oxidoreductase). Under this constraints, ATP formed by non-cyclic photophosphorylation is not sufficient to fulfill ATP/NADPH ratio for carbon fixation, therefore plastid imports ATP from cytoplasm.

We construct increasingly elaborate models of the system at different levels of detail, which are used to generate new hypotheses and influence further experimental design.\n\n\nASSAYS\nAnalysis of gene expression rates at different aerobiosis levels via RT-PCR\nAnalysis of by-product formation rates in MG1655\nFNR activity at different aerobiosis levels (steady state)\nDetermination of intracellular metabolite concentrations\nPhysiological measurements from Sheffield chemostat\nTranscriptional profiling of E. coli during anaerobic to aerobic and aerobic to anaerobic transitions\nTranscriptional profiling of steady states at different aerobiosis levels\nDetermination of intracellular redox state by means of NAD/NADH ratio\nDetermination of intracellular redox state by means of ubiquinones (oxd/red-ratio)\nMeasurement of cytochrome numbers\nKinetic modelling of Escherichia coli's electron transport chain\nKinetic modelling of Escherichia coli's electron transport chain coupled to a simplified growth model\nCharacterization of E. coli MG1655 and ∆sdhC and ∆frdA isogenic mutant strains in batch growth\nSteady State Oxygen Response of E. coli WT and two Electron Transport Chain Mutants\nAerobic and anaerobic characterization of MG1655 and mutant strains with regard to growth, by-product formation and cAMP concentrations.\nCharacterization of MG1655 and mutant strains under conditions of glucose excess and limitation.\nAerobic and anaerobic characterization of MG1655 and mutant strains with regard to transcription profiles.\nLiterature Data from Alexeeva et al., J.

Libraries were sequenced at the Norwegian Sequencing Centre (NSC). All libraries were pooled, and the same pool was sequenced on 4 flow cell lanes on a HiSeq 3000 machine (Illumina), generating 100bp single-end reads. \nRNA sequencing files (.fastq) were processed in the following manner: (i) All reads from the same individual were merged into one fastq file. (ii) Reads were mapped to the Atlantic salmon genome (GenBank Accession number: GCA_0002333375.4) using STAR (v 2.6.0c) 50. (iii) Read alignments, recorded in BAM format were subsequently used to count uniquely mapped reads per gene using featurecounts (v1.4.4) 51, with the RefSeq gene_ids. Raw illumina reads as well as gene counts are publicly available through ArrayExpress 52 accession E-MTAB-7220.  \n\n\nCREATORS\nSahar Hassani\nDATA_FILES\nCombined.counts\nCrispr_metadata\nPEOPLE\nSahar Hassani\nPROJECTS\nDigiSal\nSTUDY\nELOVL2 Knockout\nSUBMITTER\nSahar Hassani\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nTBARS: Oxidative stress(id: 754 | type: assays)\n\nDescription: TBARS assay measured oxidative stress as levels of malondialdehyde in samples.\nPerformed in cod liver samples.\n\n\nCREATORS\nKarina Dale\nDATA_FILES\nKollevåg biometrics\nTBARS_Kollevåg\nPEOPLE\nKarina Dale\nPROJECTS\nSystems toxicology of Atlantic cod\nSTUDY\nCaging study - Kollevåg\nSUBMITTER\nKarina Dale\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nGene expression(id: 753 | type: assays)\n\nDescription: Analyses of gene expression: qPCR analyses in liver (relative expression) and ovaries (absolute expression). \n\n\nCREATORS\nKarina Dale\nDATA_FILES\nKollevåg biometrics\nqPCR ovaries_Kollevåg\nqPCR liver_Kollevåg\nPEOPLE\nKarina Dale\nPROJECTS\nSystems toxicology of Atlantic cod\nSTUDY\nCaging study - Kollevåg\nSUBMITTER\nKarina Dale\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\n"

ITNs bring together universities, research institutes, industry and clinical partners from across the world to train researchers to doctorate level.\n\nMetabolic diseases are a burden on the European population and health care system. It is increasingly recognised that individual differences with respect to history, lifestyle, and genetic make-up affect disease progression and treatment response. A Systems Medicine approach, based on computational models fed with individual patient data, has the potential to provide the basis for a personalised diagnosis and treatment strategy. The PoLiMeR consortium (Polymers in the Liver: Metabolism and Regulation) has identified the inherited, liver-related diseases of glycogen and lipid metabolism as the ideal starting point for innovative research training in personalised ‘Systems Medicine'.\n\n\nINSTITUTIONS\nHeidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies (HITS gGmbH)\nUniversity of Bergen\nUniversity of Duesseldorf\nUniversity of Groningen\nUniversity of Leiden\nChalmers University of Technology\nUniversity of Freiburg\nUniversity of Luxembourg\nIceni Diagnostics Ltd\nJohn Innes Centre\nMimetas\nORGANISMS\nHomo sapiens\nPEOPLE\nOlga Krebs\nWolfgang Müller\nBarbara Bakker\nAdil Mardinoglu\nInes Thiele\nKathrin Thedieck\nMathias Ziegler\nKaren Van Eunen\nMaaike H.

My research aims at understanding how energy metabolism is integrated and regulated. My work includes experimental, modelling as well as theoretical research. Recently I studied how metabolic regulation and gene-expression regulation work together towards in integrated response, e.g. when parasites are confronted with chemical inhibitors. Much of my work has been about the regulation of glycolysis and its various modes of action (steady-state, oscillations, turbo explosion).\nMy current research deals with the integration of different metabolic pathways. Research lines include:\n- Switching between lipids and carbohydrates and how this is affected in various metabolic diseases;\n- The relation between metabolism and biologial ageing;\n- The integration of redox and energy metabolism in African trypanosomes (SysMO project).\n\n\nINSTITUTIONS\nUniversity of Groningen\nMODELS\nModel of Trypanosoma brucei glycolysis as published in Achcar et al.

Hands-on sessions, lectures and software demonstrations will provide attendees with the necessary skills to apply components of the FAIRDOM infrastructure in their daily work for interrelating and exchanging data, models and corresponding information.\n\nFAIRDOM is a research infrastructure offering data management support. The SEEK software is designed as registry and storage place for data, models, biological samples, processes, publications and presentations, and at the same time as yellow pages for projects, people and events. SEEK is implemented as central data management platform in research networks such as LiSyM (https://seek.lisym.org), but also as cross-project platform FAIRDOMhub (https://www.fairdomhub.org) used e.g. by the European ERASysAPP initiative. The tutorial is jointly organized by LiSyM, ERASysAPP and the the German Network for Bioinformatics Infrastructure (de.NBI).\n\nParticipants need to bring their own laptop.\n\n\nPRESENTATIONS\nFAIRDOM tutorial workshop SBMC2018 Bremen - Introduction\nFAIRDOM tutorial workshop SBMC2018 Bremen - Introduction into SABIO-RK\nFAIRDOM tutorial workshop SBMC2018 Bremen - SEEK_Hands-on-tasks\nFAIRDOM tutorial workshop SBMC2018 Bremen - SEEK-slides_Hands-on\nFAIRDOM tutorial workshop SBMC2018 Bremen - SEEK_api-slides\nFAIRDOM tutorial workshop SBMC2018 Bremen - SEEK-access_Jupyter_notebook\nPROJECTS\nFAIRDOM\nde.NBI-SysBio\nEarly Metabolic Injury (LiSyM-EMI - Pillar I)\nChronic Liver Disease Progression (LiSyM-DP - Pillar II)\nRegeneration and Repair in Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (LiSyM-ACLF - Pillar III)\nLiSyM Core Infrastructure and Management (LiSyM-PD)\nLiver Function Diagnostics (LiSyM-LiFuDi - Pillar IV)\nModel Guided Pharmacotherapy In Chronic Liver Disease (LiSyM-MGP)\nMulti-Scale Models for Personalized Liver Function Tests (LiSyM-MM-PLF)\nThe Hedgehog Signalling Pathway (LiSyM-JGMMS)\nMolecular Steatosis - Imaging & Modeling (LiSyM-MSIM)\nSUBMITTER\nMartin Golebiewski\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nqPCR liver_Kollevåg(id: 2279 | type: data_files)\n\nDescription: Gene expression data of various genes from cod liver.\n\n\nASSAYS\nGene expression\nPEOPLE\nKarina Dale\nPROJECTS\nSystems toxicology of Atlantic cod\nSTUDIES\nCaging study - Kollevåg\nSUBMITTER\nKarina Dale\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nTerry G.J.

We report a multiscale mathematical model of the Human liver comprising the scales from single hepatocytes, over representation of ultra-structure and micro-circulation in the hepatic tissue, up to the entire organ integrated with perfusion. The model was validated against data on multiple spatial and temporal scales. Herein we describe the model construction and application to hepatic galactose metabolism demonstrating its utility via i) the personalization of liver function tests based on galactose elimination capacity (GEC), ii) the explanation of changes in liver function with aging, and iii) the prediction of population variability in liver function based on variability in liver volume and perfusion. We conclude that physiology- and morphology-based multiscale models can improve the evaluation of individual liver function. \n\nAvailability: Personalized prediction of liver function (GEC) was implemented in a proof-of-principle app available at https://www.livermetabolism.com/gec_app/.

Libraries were sequenced at the Norwegian Sequencing Centre (NSC). All libraries were pooled, and the same pool was sequenced on 4 flow cell lanes on a HiSeq 3000 machine (Illumina), generating 100bp single-end reads. \nRNA sequencing files (.fastq) were processed in the following manner: (i) All reads from the same individual were merged into one fastq file. (ii) Reads were mapped to the Atlantic salmon genome (GenBank Accession number: GCA_0002333375.4) using STAR (v 2.6.0c) 50. (iii) Read alignments, recorded in BAM format were subsequently used to count uniquely mapped reads per gene using featurecounts (v1.4.4) 51, with the RefSeq gene_ids. Raw illumina reads as well as gene counts are publicly available through ArrayExpress 52 accession E-MTAB-7220.  \n\n\nCREATORS\nSahar Hassani\nDATA_FILES\nCombined.counts\nCrispr_metadata\nPEOPLE\nSahar Hassani\nPROJECTS\nDigiSal\nSTUDY\nELOVL2 Knockout\nSUBMITTER\nSahar Hassani\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nJan Boren(id: 783 | type: people)\n\nDescription: POSITION:  Professor of Cardiovascular Research at University of Gothenburg, chair of Dept of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, Institute of Medicine, University of Gothenburg, and part-time physician at Clinical Chemistry, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden\n\nRESEARCH:  My main long-term interest has been to understand the underlying mechanisms that lead to, and consequences of, lipid accumulation in the liver, arterial wall and heart, with the goal of translating this knowledge into effective treatment.

The quantification of these liver functions is essential to assess the status of the liver, obtain information about the degree of impairment, to evaluate treatment response or to select transplant recipients.\n\nWithin the Systems Medicine of the Liver (LiSyM) consortium we establish a standardized multiscale model framework of the human liver readily adaptable to various quantitative liver function tests currently used in the clinics. The resulting models will be personalized with individual imaging data from CT and PET in combination with anthropomorphic information like gender, age, body weight and height and used for the evaluation of quantitative liver function tests in a personalized context. \n\n\nASSAYS\nGalactose Modelling\nDATA_FILES\ncy3sabiork-SupplementaryFile-S1\ncy3sabiork-SupplementaryFile-S2\nINSTITUTIONS\nHumboldt-Universität zu Berlin\nCharité University Medicine Berlin\nHumboldt University Berlin\nINVESTIGATIONS\nTools and standards for computational modeling in biology\nMM-PLF: Multiscale modeling for personalized liver function\nMODELS\nHepatic galactose model\nPRESENTATIONS\nManagement of data, models, analyses and code for reproducible computational research: Present and Future\nPAL report – Data management LiSyM Multiscale Models for Liver Function Tests\nPROJECTS\nMulti-Scale Models for Personalized Liver Function Tests (LiSyM-MM-PLF)\nKinetics on the move - Workshop 2016\nFAIRDOM user meeting\nCOMBINE Multicellular Modelling\nFAIRDOM & LiSyM & de.NBI Data Structuring Training\nPUBLICATIONS\ncy3sabiork: A Cytoscape app for visualizing kinetic data from SABIO-RK\nToward community standards and software for whole-cell modeling\nHarmonizing semantic annotations for computational models in biology\nSTUDIES\nA Multiscale Computational Model of Human Galactose Metabolism\nHuman Caffeine Metabolism\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nHepatic galactose model(id: 226 | type: models)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nASSAYS\nGalactose Modelling\nCREATORS\nMatthias König\nINVESTIGATIONS\nMM-PLF: Multiscale modeling for personalized liver function\nPEOPLE\nMatthias König\nPROJECTS\nMulti-Scale Models for Personalized Liver Function Tests (LiSyM-MM-PLF)\nSTUDIES\nA Multiscale Computational Model of Human Galactose Metabolism\nSUBMITTER\nMatthias König\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nIMOMESIC(id: 24 | type: projects)\n\nDescription: IMOMESIC - Integrating Modelling of Metabolism and Signalling towards an Application in Liver Cancer\n\nOne of the most challenging questions in cancer research is currently the interconnection of metabolism and signalling. An understanding of mechanisms that facilitate the physiological shift towards a proliferative metabolism in cancer cells is considered a major upcoming topic in oncology and is a key activity for future drug development. Due to the complexity of interrelations, a systems biology approach would be most suited. However, rarely a systems biology approach is taken that: (i) works at standard conditions, (ii) combines modelling and quantitative data generation on metabolism and signalling, (iii) considers primary healthy and cancerous cells, and (iv) addresses patient heterogeneity. This project covers all these aspects. It is therefore timely, highly innovative and demonstrates the potential of systems biology towards an application in oncology. \n\nKey questions:\nWhich isoforms of glycolytic enzymes and key signalling components are relevant in hepatocytes and hepatoma cells?\n\nHow does growth factor and inflammatory signalling affect glycolysis in hepatocytes and hepatoma cells?\n\nCan we design strategies for combinatorial interventions of metabolism and signal transduction to inhibit proliferation of cancer cells but not affecting healthy cells?\n\n\n\n\nINSTITUTIONS\nVU University Amsterdam\nChalmers University of Technology\nUniversity of Freiburg\nGerman Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)\nCharité University Medicine Berlin\nGriffin Discoveries BV\nUniversitätsklinikum Leipzig\nORGANISMS\nHomo sapiens\nPEOPLE\nBas Teusink\nJens Nielsen\nJurgen  Haanstra\nFrank Bruggerman\nUrsula Klingmüller\nDaniel Seehofer\nJens Timmer\nIwan De Esch\nMarkus Stepath\nAdil Mardinoglu\nAvlant Nilsson\nGeorg Damm\nJoep Vanlier\nMelanie Kiessig\nIrina Titkova\nMartin Böhm\nGerda Schicht\nPROGRAMMES\nERASysAPP\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nChalmers University of Technology(id: 63 | type: institutions)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nPEOPLE\nJens Nielsen\nEduard Kerkhoven\nAndré Kelkkanen Innovationskontor\nAdil Mardinoglu\nAvlant Nilsson\nSimonas Marcisauskas\nBoyang Ji\nHao Wang\nPROJECTS\nSCaRAB\nSysMilk\nIMOMESIC\nSYSTERACT\nHUMET Startup\nPoLiMeR -   Polymers in the Liver: Metabolism and Regulation\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nAn update on SEEK BioSamples\n(id: 51 | type: presentations)\n\nDescription: Olga's presentation at SySMO PALs meeting 29 – 30 November 2012, Heidelberg\n\n\n\nCREATORS\nOlga Krebs\nEVENTS\n6th All hands PALs meeting on 29 - 30 of November 2012 in Heidelberg\nPEOPLE\nOlga Krebs\nPROJECTS\nSysMO DB\nSUBMITTER\nOlga Krebs\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nGene expression(id: 753 | type: assays)\n\nDescription: Analyses of gene expression: qPCR analyses in liver (relative expression) and ovaries (absolute expression). \n\n\nCREATORS\nKarina Dale\nDATA_FILES\nKollevåg biometrics\nqPCR ovaries_Kollevåg\nqPCR liver_Kollevåg\nPEOPLE\nKarina Dale\nPROJECTS\nSystems toxicology of Atlantic cod\nSTUDY\nCaging study - Kollevåg\nSUBMITTER\nKarina Dale\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nUniversity of Leiden(id: 40 | type: institutions)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nPEOPLE\nPaul Heusden\nKaty Wolstencroft\nWouter Hendriksen\nGilles P.

Anton is a leading researcher in skeletal muscle and integrative human physiology and metabolism with 185 peer reviewed journal publications and a Web of Science h-index of 50. His research is focussing on mechanisms by which impairments in fat metabolism lead to impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and muscle wasting (sarcopenia) in sedentary, obese, and elderly individuals, and on the design of optimal exercise/nutrition interventions that can be implemented in real life and reverse mechanisms that lead to development of the ageing phenotype and chronic disease. In these intervention studies the underlying molecular and physiological mechanisms are investigaetd as well. Anton is a leading expert in stable isotope methodology measuring glucose, fatty acid and protein kinetics in living human beings. Confocal immunohistochemical microscopy methods have been developed more recently to stain key enzymes playing a role in insulin resistance mechanisms in sections of skeletal muscle and its microvasculature to visualise the spatial distribution and co-localisation with membranes, mitochondria, lipid droplets and the endothelial layer of muscle arterioles and capillaries. This research has generated compelling evidence that insulin resistance occurs both in muscle fibers and their microvasculature. In obesity, metabolic syndrome and ageing insulin mediated dilation of the muscle microvasculature is impaired due to failure of insulin to activate eNOS (ser1177-P) and quenching of NO by superoxide anions (generated by NADPH oxidase). As a result of impaired arteriolar dilation the muscle fibres are starved of nutrients in well-fed bodies and meal derived glucose, lipids and amino acids are deposited in non-muscle tissues such as liver and adipose tissue. Anton was Editor for the Journal of Physiology (2007-14) and Chair of the Scientific Board of the European College of Sport Sciences (2007-15). Anton currently is Editor of the American Journal of Physiology - Endocrinology and Metabolism, and has a Web of Science h-index of 50. \n\n\n\nINSTITUTIONS\nLiverpool John Moores University\nPROJECTS\nHUMET Startup\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nReport of the Data Management Foundry Workshop,  19th-20th of March, 2012, Vienna, Austria(id: 1320 | type: data_files)\n\nDescription: Report of the Data Management Foundry Workshop, \n19th-20th of March, 2012, Vienna, Austria\n\n\n\nCREATORS\nNatalie Stanford\nKaty Wolstencroft\nOlga Krebs\nStuart Owen\nCarole Goble\nWolfgang Müller\nPEOPLE\nKaty Wolstencroft\nCarole Goble\nStuart Owen\nOlga Krebs\nWolfgang Müller\nNatalie Stanford\nPROJECTS\nFAIRDOM\nSUBMITTER\nNatalie Stanford\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nMartin Golebiewski(id: 623 | type: people)\n\nDescription: Data management and standardization expert for systems biology and systems medicine, responsible for the data management user requirements and user contacts within the German LiSyM network (Liver Systems Medicine: http://lisym.org/) and associated to the FAIRDOM team.\nInvolved in different standardization initiatives and committees, i.e. COMBINE (http://co.mbine.org), ISO/TC 276 Biotechnology (https://www.iso.org/committee/4514241.html), European COST action CHARME (http://www.cost-charme.eu) and others.\n\n\nDATA_FILES\nAgenda Data Structuring Course\nEVENTS\nFirst LiSyM PostDoc and PhD student retreat\nJoint LiSyM & ERASysAPP Data Management PALs Meeting\n1st LiSyM Jamboree & SAB Meeting\nFAIRDOM-LiSyM-de.NBI Data Structuring Course - Nov 22-23 - Hünfeld (D)\n19th International Conference on Systems Biology (ICSB2018)\n7th Conference on Systems Biology of Mammalian Cells (SBMC 2018)\nLiSyM/de.NBI/ERASysAPP Tutorial: How to Share FAIR — The FAIRDOM Data and Model Management Practice\nINSTITUTIONS\nHeidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies (HITS gGmbH)\nPRESENTATIONS\nFAIRDOM tutorial workshop SBMC2018 Bremen - Introduction\nPROJECTS\nFAIRDOM\nEarly Metabolic Injury (LiSyM-EMI - Pillar I)\nChronic Liver Disease Progression (LiSyM-DP - Pillar II)\nRegeneration and Repair in Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (LiSyM-ACLF - Pillar III)\nLiSyM Core Infrastructure and Management (LiSyM-PD)\nLiver Function Diagnostics (LiSyM-LiFuDi - Pillar IV)\nModel Guided Pharmacotherapy In Chronic Liver Disease (LiSyM-MGP)\nMulti-Scale Models for Personalized Liver Function Tests (LiSyM-MM-PLF)\nThe Hedgehog Signalling Pathway (LiSyM-JGMMS)\nMolecular Steatosis - Imaging & Modeling (LiSyM-MSIM)\nKinetics on the move - Workshop 2016\nExample use cases\nFAIRDOM user meeting\nMS_DILI\nCOMBINE Multicellular Modelling\nFAIRDOM & LiSyM & de.NBI Data Structuring Training\nNew LiSyM project\nEnzymeML\nGMDS Project Group \"FAIRe Dateninfrastrukturen für die Biomedizinische Informatik\"\nPUBLICATIONS\nFAIRDOMHub: a repository and collaboration environment for sharing systems biology research\nThe Human Physiome: how standards, software and innovative service infrastructures are providing the building blocks to make it achievable\nSpecifications of Standards in Systems and Synthetic Biology: Status and Developments in 2016.\nSABIO-RK, von Daten in der Publikation zur Suchlösung für Spezialisten\nHarmonizing semantic annotations for computational models in biology\nSpecifications of Standards in Systems and Synthetic Biology: Status and Developments in 2017\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nHumboldt-Universität zu Berlin(id: 13 | type: institutions)\n\nDescription: missing\n\n\nPEOPLE\nEdda Klipp\nSimon Borger\nSusanne Gerber\nFalko Krause\nMamadou Bah\nSeverin Ehret\nMarcus Krantz\nMatthias König\nJudith Wodke\nClemens Kühn\nPROJECTS\nTRANSLUCENT\nICYSB 2015 - International Practical Course in Systems Biology\nMulti-Scale Models for Personalized Liver Function Tests (LiSyM-MM-PLF)\nCOMBINE Multicellular Modelling\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nWolfgang Müller(id: 205 | type: people)\n\nDescription: I am group leader of the SDBV (Scientific Databases and Visualisation) group at the HITS gGmbH, the Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies.\n\nI am interested in finding data.

The aim of this unique research program is to acquire and use new experimental data and data from existing data bases to build computational models that facilitate decision making at the patient's bedsite and to predict the actions of new medicines in the treatment of metabolic liver disease.\n\n\nADMINISTRATORS\nMartin Golebiewski\nWolfgang Müller\nJohannes Bausch\nASSAYS\nGalactose Modelling\nDATA_FILES\ncy3sabiork-SupplementaryFile-S2\nAgenda Data Structuring Course\nEVENTS\nFirst LiSyM PostDoc and PhD student retreat\nJoint LiSyM & ERASysAPP Data Management PALs Meeting\n1st LiSyM Jamboree & SAB Meeting\nFAIRDOM-LiSyM-de.NBI Data Structuring Course - Nov 22-23 - Hünfeld (D)\n7th Conference on Systems Biology of Mammalian Cells (SBMC 2018)\nLiSyM/de.NBI/ERASysAPP Tutorial: How to Share FAIR — The FAIRDOM Data and Model Management Practice\nINSTITUTIONS\nHeidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies (HITS gGmbH)\nHumboldt-Universität zu Berlin\nUniversity of Rostock\nNorwegian University of Life Sciences\nTechnical University of Munich\nUniversity of Freiburg\nTechnische Universität Dresden\nGerman Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)\nCharité University Medicine Berlin\nHumboldt University Berlin\nUniversität Leipzig - Medizinische Fakultät - Institut für Biochemie\nLeibniz-Institut für Arbeitsforschung (IfADo)\nUniversitätsklinikum Dresden - Medizinische Klinik I, Bereich Gastroenterologie & Hepatologie\nRWTH Aachen University Hospital - Department of Internal Medicine III\nUniversity Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, General Surgery\nINVESTIGATIONS\nTools and standards for computational modeling in biology\nMM-PLF: Multiscale modeling for personalized liver function\nMODELS\nHepatic galactose model\nMorpheus: open source modelling and simulation framework for multicellular systems\nMorpheus model of spatio-temporal Smo regulation in response to Hh signaling\nSpatio-temporal dynamics of Rab5 domains on the membrane of early endosomes\nPEOPLE\nMaksim Zakhartsev\nOlga Krebs\nWolfgang Müller\nMaja Rey\nUrsula Klingmüller\nJens Timmer\nUlrike Wittig\nMartin Golebiewski\nMatthias König\nMartin Böhm\nJohannes Bausch\nLutz Brusch\nMadlen Matz-Soja\nChristiane Rennert\nSteffen Brinkmann\nErik Schröder\nAhmed Ghallab\nVincent Moser\nMax Luedemann\nJanine Koehncke\nAida Ayoubzadeh\nWitigo Von Schönfels\nPRESENTATIONS\nPAL report – Data management LiSyM Multiscale Models for Liver Function Tests\nIntroduction to FAIRDOM Data Management : SEEK and openBIS\nFAIRDOM tutorial workshop SBMC2018 Bremen - Introduction\nPROJECTS\nEarly Metabolic Injury (LiSyM-EMI - Pillar I)\nChronic Liver Disease Progression (LiSyM-DP - Pillar II)\nRegeneration and Repair in Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (LiSyM-ACLF - Pillar III)\nLiSyM Core Infrastructure and Management (LiSyM-PD)\nLiver Function Diagnostics (LiSyM-LiFuDi - Pillar IV)\nModel Guided Pharmacotherapy In Chronic Liver Disease (LiSyM-MGP)\nMulti-Scale Models for Personalized Liver Function Tests (LiSyM-MM-PLF)\nThe Hedgehog Signalling Pathway (LiSyM-JGMMS)\nMolecular Steatosis - Imaging & Modeling (LiSyM-MSIM)\nFAIRDOM & LiSyM & de.NBI Data Structuring Training\nNew LiSyM project\nPUBLICATIONS\ncy3sabiork: A Cytoscape app for visualizing kinetic data from SABIO-RK\nToward community standards and software for whole-cell modeling\nHedgehog signaling is a potent regulator of liver lipid metabolism and reveals a GLI-code associated with steatosis\nThe Human Physiome: how standards, software and innovative service infrastructures are providing the building blocks to make it achievable\nSpecifications of Standards in Systems and Synthetic Biology: Status and Developments in 2016.\nSABIO-RK, von Daten in der Publikation zur Suchlösung für Spezialisten\nMorpheus: a user-friendly modeling environment for multiscale and multicellular systems biology.\nA Predictive 3D Multi-Scale Model of Biliary Fluid Dynamics in the Liver Lobule.\npSSAlib: The partial-propensity stochastic chemical network simulator\nSpecifications of Standards in Systems and Synthetic Biology: Status and Developments in 2017\nSTUDIES\nA Multiscale Computational Model of Human Galactose Metabolism\nHuman Caffeine Metabolism\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nGenoSysFat(id: 34 | type: projects)\n\nDescription: Salmon farmed on modern feeds contains less of the healthy, long-chain fatty acids (EPA and DHA) than before. Up until the turn of the millennium, farmed salmon were fed fish oil as a replacement for their omega-3 rich natural prey. However, fish oil is now a scarce resource, and more than half of the fat in modern feeds comes from plant oils that are inexpensive, but devoid of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids. How can we increase the omega-3 content of salmon on sustainable feeds?\n\nOne option is to breed salmon that are well adapted to the feeds of the future. There is heritable variation in salmon’s ability to build EPA and DHA from shorter omega-3 fatty acids. The DNA sequence of salmon is now well known, allowing rapid characterization of heritable differences in nutrient utilization. A salmon family that appears promising on one feed, may not be the best on another. Therefore, we need to understand the salmon’s body as a system: a functional whole made up of parts that mutually affect, but also depend on, each other. A systems understanding of the interplay between feed and genetic factors will allow a tailoring of fish to feed and vice versa, which is robust to fluctuations in feedstuff availability and pricing.\n\nAs a first step towards such a systems understanding, the GenoSysFat project involves two biological experiments. 1) A traditional feeding experiment using high- vs low-omega-3 diets and salmon families that differ in feed utilization. 2) A novel study with pieces of liver kept alive and “fed” in laboratory dishes, studying for each fish how different feeds affect metabolism and gene activity. This allows faster and more detailed exploration of the interplay between genetics and feeds. Results will be interpreted with the help of mathematical models for the biochemical reaction networks, which are well established for other species and will be adapted to salmon based on the newly sequenced salmon genome.\n\n\nDATA_FILES\nSalmon genome\nCombined taxonomy table from freshwater and saltwater samples\nINSTITUTIONS\nNorwegian University of Science and Technology\nUniversity of Bergen\nUniversity of Rostock\nWageningen University & Research\nNorwegian University of Life Sciences\nSchool of Computer Science, University of Manchester\nCargill\nORGANISMS\nDanio rerio\nSalmo salar\nOncorhynchus mykiss\nPEOPLE\nVitor Martins Dos Santos\nMaksim Zakhartsev\nStuart Owen\nNatalie Stanford\nJon Olav Vik\nArne Gjuvsland\nDagmar Waltemath\nSandve Simen\nGareth Gillard\nJacob Seilø Torgersen\nHanne Hellerud Hansen\nKristil  Sundsaasen\nFabian Grammes\nThomas Harvey\nGraceline Tina Kirubakaran\nLars Snipen\nDominic Nanton\nJesse Van Dam\nTorgeir R.
